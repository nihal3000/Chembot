Isomerism in organic compounds
Which of the following pairs of organic compounds exhibit geometric isomerism: (a) 2-butene and 2-methylpropene; (b) cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane and trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane; (c) 2-chloropropane and 2-bromopropane; (d) ethyl butanoate and methyl propanoate. Explain your answer.
Geometric isomerism occurs when there is restricted rotation around a double bond or a ring structure, leading to different spatial arrangements of substituents. Let's analyze each pair of compounds:

(a) 2-butene and 2-methylpropene: 
2-butene has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, which allows for geometric isomerism (cis and trans). However, 2-methylpropene has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, with a methyl group on carbon 2. This structure does not allow for geometric isomerism, as there are not two different substituents on each carbon of the double bond. So, this pair does not exhibit geometric isomerism.

(b) cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane and trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:
These compounds have a cyclohexane ring with two methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2. The cis and trans prefixes indicate the relative positions of the methyl groups. In the cis isomer, both methyl groups are on the same side of the ring, while in the trans isomer, they are on opposite sides. This pair exhibits geometric isomerism due to the different spatial arrangements of the methyl groups.

(c) 2-chloropropane and 2-bromopropane:
Both compounds have a single bond between carbons 2 and 3, which allows for free rotation. There is no double bond or ring structure to restrict rotation, so these compounds do not exhibit geometric isomerism.

(d) ethyl butanoate and methyl propanoate:
Both compounds are esters, with ethyl butanoate having an ethyl group and a butyl group, and methyl propanoate having a methyl group and a propyl group. There is no double bond or ring structure in these compounds to restrict rotation, so they do not exhibit geometric isomerism.

In conclusion, only pair (b) cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane and trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane exhibit geometric isomerism.
