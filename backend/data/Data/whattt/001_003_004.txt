Stereochemistry and chirality
Identify the number of chiral centers present in (2R,3S)-butane-1,4-diol and draw all possible stereoisomers for the compound.
(2R,3S)-butane-1,4-diol has two chiral centers: one at carbon 2 and another at carbon 3. 

There are four possible stereoisomers for this compound, which can be represented as follows:

1. (2R,3S)-butane-1,4-diol
   HO-CH2-CH(2R)(OH)-CH(3S)(OH)-CH2-OH

2. (2S,3S)-butane-1,4-diol
   HO-CH2-CH(2S)(OH)-CH(3S)(OH)-CH2-OH

3. (2R,3R)-butane-1,4-diol
   HO-CH2-CH(2R)(OH)-CH(3R)(OH)-CH2-OH

4. (2S,3R)-butane-1,4-diol
   HO-CH2-CH(2S)(OH)-CH(3R)(OH)-CH2-OH

These four stereoisomers are the possible combinations of the R and S configurations at the two chiral centers.
