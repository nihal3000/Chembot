Isomerism in organic compounds
Identify and classify the isomers of the compound C6H12O that possess a functional group of ketone. Provide their respective structural formulas and explain how they differ from one another.
There are three isomers of the compound C6H12O that possess a ketone functional group. These isomers are classified as follows:

1. Hexan-2-one:
This isomer has the ketone functional group at the second carbon atom. The structural formula is as follows:

CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

2. Hexan-3-one:
This isomer has the ketone functional group at the third carbon atom. The structural formula is as follows:

CH3-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3

3. 4-Methylpentan-3-one:
This isomer has a methyl group at the fourth carbon atom and the ketone functional group at the third carbon atom. The structural formula is as follows:

CH3-CH2-CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

These isomers differ from one another in the position of the ketone functional group and the presence of a methyl group in the third isomer. The first two isomers are linear, while the third isomer has a branched structure.
