Isomerism in organic compounds
How many constitutional isomers can be obtained from the molecular formula C6H14?
The molecular formula C6H14 represents an alkane with six carbon atoms. To determine the number of constitutional isomers, we need to consider the different ways the carbon atoms can be connected.

1. Hexane (all six carbon atoms in a straight chain): CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3
2. 2-Methylpentane (five carbon atoms in a straight chain, with one methyl group on the second carbon): CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3
3. 3-Methylpentane (five carbon atoms in a straight chain, with one methyl group on the third carbon): CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3
4. 2,2-Dimethylbutane (four carbon atoms in a straight chain, with two methyl groups on the second carbon): CH3-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH3
5. 2,3-Dimethylbutane (four carbon atoms in a straight chain, with one methyl group on the second carbon and one on the third carbon): CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH3

There are a total of 5 constitutional isomers that can be obtained from the molecular formula C6H14.
