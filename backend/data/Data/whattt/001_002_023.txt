Isomerism in organic compounds
What is the difference between structural isomerism and stereoisomerism in organic compounds, and how can you distinguish between them? Provide examples to illustrate your answer.
Structural isomerism and stereoisomerism are two types of isomerism found in organic compounds. Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms or orientation in space. Here's the difference between structural isomerism and stereoisomerism, along with examples:

1. Structural Isomerism (also known as constitutional isomerism):
In structural isomerism, isomers have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms or connectivity. This means that the atoms are bonded together in different ways, leading to different structures. Structural isomerism can be further divided into several categories, such as chain isomerism, position isomerism, and functional group isomerism.

Example:
Consider the molecular formula C4H10. It has two structural isomers:

a) n-Butane: CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3
b) Isobutane (methylpropane): (CH3)3CH

These two compounds have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms.

2. Stereoisomerism:
In stereoisomerism, isomers have the same molecular formula and connectivity of atoms but different spatial arrangements or orientations. Stereoisomers can be further divided into two categories: enantiomers and diastereomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, while diastereomers are not mirror images.

Example:
Consider the compound 2-butanol (C4H10O). It has two stereoisomers:

a) (R)-2-butanol
b) (S)-2-butanol

These two compounds have the same molecular formula and connectivity of atoms but differ in the spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl group (-OH) and the hydrogen atom around the chiral carbon (the second carbon atom in the chain).

To distinguish between structural isomers and stereoisomers, you can follow these steps:

1. Compare the molecular formula of the compounds. If they are different, they are not isomers.
2. If the molecular formula is the same, check the connectivity of atoms. If the connectivity is different, they are structural isomers.
3. If the connectivity of atoms is the same, check the spatial arrangement of atoms or groups. If the spatial arrangement is different, they are stereoisomers.

In summary, structural isomerism involves different connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomerism involves different spatial arrangements of atoms or groups with the same connectivity.
