Isomerism in organic compounds
Consider two organic compounds with the molecular formula C5H10, one of which is a cyclic alkene and the other one is an acyclic alkene. Both of them exhibit positional isomerism as well. Identify the two compounds and draw their structural formulas.
The two organic compounds with the molecular formula C5H10 are cyclopentene (cyclic alkene) and 2-pentene (acyclic alkene). Both of these compounds exhibit positional isomerism.

1. Cyclopentene:
Cyclopentene is a cyclic alkene with a five-membered ring and one double bond. Its structural formula is as follows:

   H H H
    | | |
H-C-C=C-C-H
    | |
    H H

2. 2-Pentene:
2-Pentene is an acyclic alkene with a carbon chain of five carbons and one double bond between the second and third carbons. Its structural formula is as follows:

H H H H H
 | | | | |
H-C-C=C-C-C-H
 | | | | |
 H H H H H

These are the two organic compounds with the molecular formula C5H10 that exhibit positional isomerism.
