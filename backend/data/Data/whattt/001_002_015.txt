Isomerism in organic compounds
How many possible chain isomers can be formed for a compound with the molecular formula C5H12?
For a compound with the molecular formula C5H12, there are three possible chain isomers:

1. n-Pentane: a straight chain of five carbon atoms
2. Isopentane (2-methylbutane): a four-carbon chain with a methyl group attached to the second carbon
3. Neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane): a three-carbon chain with two methyl groups attached to the second carbon

So, there are 3 possible chain isomers for C5H12.
