Isomerism in organic compounds
How many constitutional isomers can be obtained for a given molecular formula C5H12?
For the molecular formula C5H12, there are three constitutional isomers. They are:

1. n-Pentane: a straight-chain alkane with all five carbon atoms connected in a row.
   CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

2. Isopentane (also called methylbutane): a branched-chain alkane with a methyl group (CH3) attached to the second carbon atom of a butane molecule.
   CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

3. Neopentane (also called dimethylpropane): a branched-chain alkane with two methyl groups (CH3) attached to the central carbon atom of a propane molecule.
   CH3-C(CH3)2-CH3
