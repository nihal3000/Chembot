Isomerism in organic compounds
What is the structural difference between cis- and trans- isomers and how does this difference affect their chemical and physical properties? Provide at least three examples of organic compounds that exhibit cis-trans isomerism and explain how their isomeric forms differ in terms of their reactivity and/or biological activity.
Cis- and trans- isomers are a type of stereoisomers, which are molecules with the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms but different three-dimensional orientations. The structural difference between cis- and trans- isomers lies in the spatial arrangement of their substituent groups around a double bond or a ring structure.

In cis-isomers, the substituent groups are on the same side of the double bond or ring, while in trans-isomers, they are on opposite sides. This difference in spatial arrangement leads to variations in their chemical and physical properties, such as melting points, boiling points, polarity, and reactivity.

Example 1: Cis- and trans-2-butene
Cis-2-butene has both methyl groups on the same side of the double bond, while trans-2-butene has them on opposite sides. The cis-isomer has a higher boiling point (3.7째C) than the trans-isomer (-6.3째C) due to the increased polarity in the cis form. The trans-isomer is more stable and less reactive than the cis-isomer because of the reduced steric hindrance between the substituent groups.

Example 2: Cis- and trans-1,2-dichloroethene
In cis-1,2-dichloroethene, both chlorine atoms are on the same side of the double bond, while in trans-1,2-dichloroethene, they are on opposite sides. The cis-isomer has a higher boiling point (60.3째C) than the trans-isomer (47.5째C) due to the increased polarity in the cis form. The trans-isomer is more stable and less reactive than the cis-isomer because of the reduced steric hindrance between the chlorine atoms.

Example 3: Cis- and trans-retinoic acid (Vitamin A)
Retinoic acid is a biologically active form of vitamin A, which plays a crucial role in vision, cell differentiation, and immune function. The cis- and trans-isomers of retinoic acid have different biological activities. The all-trans-retinoic acid is the most biologically active form and is used as a medication for treating acne and certain types of leukemia. The 9-cis-retinoic acid is less biologically active but still plays a role in some cellular processes.

In summary, the structural difference between cis- and trans- isomers lies in the spatial arrangement of their substituent groups around a double bond or ring structure. This difference affects their chemical and physical properties, such as melting points, boiling points, polarity, and reactivity. Organic compounds like 2-butene, 1,2-dichloroethene, and retinoic acid exhibit cis-trans isomerism, and their isomeric forms differ in terms of reactivity and/or biological activity.
