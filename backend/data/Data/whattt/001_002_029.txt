Isomerism in organic compounds
Identify the type of isomerism exhibited by 2-pentene and 2-methylbutene and explain why they are isomers of each other?
2-pentene and 2-methylbutene exhibit structural isomerism, also known as constitutional isomerism. This type of isomerism occurs when molecules have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms in their structures.

Both 2-pentene and 2-methylbutene have the same molecular formula, C5H10, but their structures are different:

1. 2-pentene has a carbon chain of five atoms with a double bond between the second and third carbons:
   CH2=CH-CH2-CH3

2. 2-methylbutene has a carbon chain of four atoms with a double bond between the second and third carbons, and a methyl group (CH3) attached to the second carbon:
   CH3-C(CH3)=CH-CH3

These different arrangements of atoms in their structures result in different chemical and physical properties, making them isomers of each other.
