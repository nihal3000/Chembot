Isomerism in organic compounds
"How many structural isomers are possible for the molecular formula C5H12 and provide their names and structures?"
There are three structural isomers possible for the molecular formula C5H12. They are:

1. n-Pentane:
Structure: CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3
Name: n-Pentane (normal pentane)

2. Isopentane (2-methylbutane):
Structure: (CH3)2CH-CH2-CH3
Name: Isopentane (2-methylbutane)

3. Neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane):
Structure: (CH3)3C-CH3
Name: Neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane)

These three isomers have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements of carbon and hydrogen atoms.
