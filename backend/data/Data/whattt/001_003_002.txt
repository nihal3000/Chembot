Stereochemistry and chirality
Identify the number of stereoisomers that can be formed from the compound 2,3-dichlorobutane, and draw their structures.
2,3-dichlorobutane has two chiral centers, which are carbons 2 and 3. To determine the number of stereoisomers, we can use the formula 2^n, where n is the number of chiral centers. In this case, n = 2, so there are 2^2 = 4 possible stereoisomers.

Here are the structures of the four stereoisomers:

1. (2R,3R)-2,3-dichlorobutane:

      Cl      Cl
       |       |
H3C - C - C - C - CH3
       |       |
       H       H

2. (2S,3S)-2,3-dichlorobutane:

      Cl      Cl
       |       |
H3C - C - C - C - CH3
       |       |
       H       H

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dichlorobutane:

      Cl      H
       |       |
H3C - C - C - C - CH3
       |       |
       H       Cl

4. (2S,3R)-2,3-dichlorobutane:

      Cl      H
       |       |
H3C - C - C - C - CH3
       |       |
       H       Cl

These four stereoisomers include two pairs of enantiomers: (2R,3R) and (2S,3S), and (2R,3S) and (2S,3R).
