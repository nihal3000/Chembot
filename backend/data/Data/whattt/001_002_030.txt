Isomerism in organic compounds
What is the difference between structural isomers and stereoisomers in organic chemistry? Provide an example of each and explain the key differences between the two types of isomers.
In organic chemistry, isomers are molecules that have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms in space. There are two main types of isomers: structural isomers and stereoisomers.

1. Structural isomers (also known as constitutional isomers) are molecules with the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms. In other words, the atoms are bonded together in a different order. This leads to differences in physical and chemical properties of the isomers.

Example: C4H10 has two structural isomers: butane and isobutane (or 2-methylpropane).

Butane:
H H H H
| | | |
H-C-C-C-C-H
  | | | |
  H H H H

Isobutane (2-methylpropane):
    H H H
    | | |
H H-C-C-C-H
  |   | |
  H   H H

In this example, both butane and isobutane have the same molecular formula (C4H10), but the connectivity of the carbon atoms is different, leading to different structures and properties.

2. Stereoisomers are molecules with the same molecular formula and connectivity of atoms but different spatial arrangements of the atoms. Stereoisomers can be further divided into two subcategories: enantiomers and diastereomers.

Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, like left and right hands. They have the same physical properties but differ in the way they interact with plane-polarized light and other chiral molecules.

Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.

Example: C4H8O2 has two stereoisomers: (R)- and (S)-lactic acid.

(R)-lactic acid:
   H O
    |
H-C-C-O-H
  |
  C-H
  |
  H

(S)-lactic acid:
   H O
    |
H-C-C-O-H
  |
  C-H
  |
  H

In this example, both (R)- and (S)-lactic acid have the same molecular formula (C4H8O2) and connectivity, but the spatial arrangement of the atoms around the chiral center (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group) is different. These two isomers are enantiomers.

In summary, the key differences between structural isomers and stereoisomers are:

- Structural isomers have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms, leading to different structures and properties.
- Stereoisomers have the same molecular formula and connectivity but different spatial arrangements of atoms, leading to different interactions with plane-polarized light and other chiral molecules (for enantiomers) or different physical and chemical properties (for diastereomers).
