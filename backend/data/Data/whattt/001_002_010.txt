Isomerism in organic compounds
Identify the type of isomerism present in the following pair of compounds: 

CH3CH2CH2OH and CH3CH2OCH3
The given pair of compounds are:

1. CH3CH2CH2OH (1-propanol)
2. CH3CH2OCH3 (methoxyethane)

These two compounds have the same molecular formula (C3H8O) but different connectivity of atoms and functional groups. This type of isomerism is called constitutional isomerism or structural isomerism.
