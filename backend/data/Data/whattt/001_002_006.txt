Isomerism in organic compounds
What are the different types of isomerism that exist in organic compounds? Provide an example of each type and explain their structural differences.
Isomerism is a phenomenon in which two or more organic compounds have the same molecular formula but different structures or arrangements of atoms. There are several types of isomerism in organic compounds, including:

1. Structural (constitutional) isomerism: Compounds with the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms. There are several subtypes of structural isomerism:

   a. Chain isomerism: Compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of the carbon skeleton. For example, pentane (CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3) and isopentane (CH3CH(CH3)CH2CH3) are chain isomers.

   b. Position isomerism: Compounds with the same molecular formula and carbon skeleton but different positions of functional groups or substituents. For example, 1-chloropropane (CH3CH2CH2Cl) and 2-chloropropane (CH3CHClCH3) are position isomers.

   c. Functional group isomerism: Compounds with the same molecular formula but different functional groups. For example, an alcohol and an ether with the molecular formula C2H6O: ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3).

2. Stereoisomerism: Compounds with the same molecular formula and connectivity of atoms but different spatial arrangements of atoms. There are two main types of stereoisomerism:

   a. Geometric (cis-trans) isomerism: Occurs in compounds with restricted rotation around a double bond or in cyclic compounds. Cis-isomers have similar groups on the same side of the double bond or ring, while trans-isomers have them on opposite sides. For example, cis-2-butene (CH3CH=CHCH3, with both CH3 groups on the same side) and trans-2-butene (CH3CH=CHCH3, with CH3 groups on opposite sides) are geometric isomers.

   b. Optical isomerism (enantiomerism): Occurs in compounds with a chiral center, usually a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. For example, (R)-2-chlorobutane and (S)-2-chlorobutane are optical isomers.

3. Conformational isomerism (conformers): Compounds with the same molecular formula and connectivity of atoms but different spatial arrangements due to rotation around single bonds. Conformers are in equilibrium with each other and can interconvert rapidly. For example, the staggered and eclipsed conformations of ethane (CH3CH3) are conformational isomers.

These are the main types of isomerism found in organic compounds, each with its unique structural differences and properties.
