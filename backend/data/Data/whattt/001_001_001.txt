Naming organic compounds
What is the IUPAC name for the organic compound with the molecular formula C6H12O2?
There can be several isomers with the molecular formula C6H12O2, so it is not possible to provide a specific IUPAC name without more information about the structure of the compound. If you can provide the structure or any additional details, I would be happy to help you determine the IUPAC name.
