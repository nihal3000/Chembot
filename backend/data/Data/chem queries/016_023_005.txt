Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose (C12H22O11) given that the enthalpy change of hydrolysis for 1 mole of sucrose is -564 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, you simply multiply the enthalpy change for 1 mole of sucrose by the number of moles.

Enthalpy change for 1 mole of sucrose = -564 kJ/mol
Number of moles = 2

Enthalpy change for 2 moles of sucrose = (-564 kJ/mol) Ã— 2 = -1128 kJ
