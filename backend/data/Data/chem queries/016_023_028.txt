Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
What is the enthalpy change of hydrolysis for 10 grams of sucrose (C12H22O11) dissolved in 100 mL of water at 25°C? Given that the enthalpy of hydrolysis for sucrose is -564.8 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change of hydrolysis for 10 grams of sucrose, we first need to determine the number of moles of sucrose present. 

The molecular weight of sucrose (C12H22O11) is:
(12 x 12.01) + (22 x 1.01) + (11 x 16.00) = 144.12 + 22.22 + 176.00 = 342.34 g/mol

Now, we can find the number of moles of sucrose in 10 grams:
moles = mass / molecular weight
moles = 10 g / 342.34 g/mol = 0.0292 mol

The enthalpy of hydrolysis for sucrose is given as -564.8 kJ/mol. To find the enthalpy change for the 10 grams of sucrose, we multiply the number of moles by the enthalpy of hydrolysis:

ΔH = moles x enthalpy of hydrolysis
ΔH = 0.0292 mol x (-564.8 kJ/mol) = -16.48 kJ

The enthalpy change of hydrolysis for 10 grams of sucrose dissolved in 100 mL of water at 25°C is approximately -16.48 kJ.
