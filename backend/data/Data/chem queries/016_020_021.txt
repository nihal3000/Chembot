Enthalpy of desorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of desorption for a solid substance using the given data: The mass of the substance is 2.5 g, and the temperature change during desorption is 25 °C. The heat capacity of the substance is 1.5 J/g·°C. The molar mass of the substance is 150 g/mol. Assume that the desorption process takes place at constant pressure.
To calculate the enthalpy change of desorption, we can use the formula:

ΔH = m × C × ΔT

where ΔH is the enthalpy change, m is the mass of the substance, C is the heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change.

Given data:
m = 2.5 g
C = 1.5 J/g·°C
ΔT = 25 °C

Now, we can plug in the values into the formula:

ΔH = (2.5 g) × (1.5 J/g·°C) × (25 °C)

ΔH = 93.75 J

The enthalpy change of desorption for the solid substance is 93.75 J.
