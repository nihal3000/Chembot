Enthalpy of ionization calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the ionization of hydrogen atoms in the gas phase, given that the ionization energy of a hydrogen atom is 1312 kJ/mol?
The enthalpy change for the ionization of hydrogen atoms in the gas phase is equal to the ionization energy of a hydrogen atom. This is because ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom or ion in the gas phase, which is an endothermic process. Therefore, the enthalpy change for the ionization of hydrogen atoms in the gas phase is 1312 kJ/mol.
