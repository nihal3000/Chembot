Enthalpy of desorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of desorption of water from a graphite surface if the initial pressure of water is 10 torr and the final pressure is 1 torr at a constant temperature of 300 K. The surface area of the graphite is 50 cm² and the heat of adsorption of water on the surface is -40 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change of desorption of water from the graphite surface, we first need to determine the number of moles of water adsorbed on the surface. We can use the Ideal Gas Law (PV = nRT) to do this, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.

First, we need to convert the pressures from torr to atm, since the gas constant R is typically given in units of atm·L/(mol·K). 

Initial pressure (P1) = 10 torr * (1 atm / 760 torr) = 0.01316 atm
Final pressure (P2) = 1 torr * (1 atm / 760 torr) = 0.00132 atm

Next, we need to determine the volume of the gas. Since we are given the surface area of the graphite, we can assume that the volume of the gas is proportional to the surface area. We can use the ratio of the initial and final pressures to determine the volume ratio:

V1 / V2 = P1 / P2
V1 / V2 = 0.01316 atm / 0.00132 atm = 10

Since the volume ratio is 10, we can assume that the initial volume (V1) is 10 times the final volume (V2). We can now use the Ideal Gas Law to determine the number of moles of water adsorbed on the surface:

PV = nRT
n = PV / RT

Since we are interested in the change in the number of moles, we can calculate the difference between the initial and final states:

Δn = n1 - n2
Δn = (P1V1 / RT) - (P2V2 / RT)

Since V1 = 10V2, we can rewrite this as:

Δn = (P1(10V2) / RT) - (P2V2 / RT)
Δn = V2 / RT * (10P1 - P2)

We can now plug in the values for P1, P2, R, and T:

Δn = V2 / (0.08206 L·atm/mol·K * 300 K) * (10 * 0.01316 atm - 0.00132 atm)
Δn = V2 / 24.618 L·atm/mol * 0.1306 atm

Since we are only interested in the enthalpy change, we do not need to determine the exact value of V2. We can now use the heat of adsorption to calculate the enthalpy change:

ΔH = Δn * heat of adsorption
ΔH = (V2 / 24.618 L·atm/mol * 0.1306 atm) * (-40 kJ/mol)

ΔH = -0.00533 * V2 * 40 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change of desorption of water from the graphite surface is -0.2132 * V2 kJ. Since we do not have enough information to determine the exact value of V2, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the enthalpy change. However, the expression -0.2132 * V2 kJ gives the enthalpy change as a function of the final volume V2.
