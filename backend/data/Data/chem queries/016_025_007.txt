Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of dissolution when 5 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) dissolves in 100 mL of water at 25°C. The molar enthalpy of dissolution of sodium chloride is -3.9 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change of dissolution, we first need to determine the number of moles of sodium chloride (NaCl) that are being dissolved. 

The molar mass of NaCl is approximately 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol for Na and 35.45 g/mol for Cl).

Now, we can calculate the number of moles of NaCl:

moles of NaCl = mass of NaCl / molar mass of NaCl
moles of NaCl = 5 g / 58.44 g/mol
moles of NaCl ≈ 0.0856 mol

Next, we can use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to calculate the enthalpy change:

enthalpy change = moles of NaCl × molar enthalpy of dissolution
enthalpy change = 0.0856 mol × (-3.9 kJ/mol)
enthalpy change ≈ -0.333 kJ

So, the enthalpy change of dissolution when 5 grams of sodium chloride dissolves in 100 mL of water at 25°C is approximately -0.333 kJ.
