Enthalpy of ionization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of ionization for sodium ion (Na+) given that the first ionization energy of sodium (Na) is 495.8 kJ/mol and the second ionization energy is 4562 kJ/mol.
The enthalpy of ionization for sodium ion (Na+) refers to the energy required to remove one electron from a neutral sodium atom (Na) to form a sodium ion (Na+). In this case, we are only concerned with the first ionization energy, as it represents the energy required to remove the first electron from the sodium atom.

The first ionization energy of sodium (Na) is given as 495.8 kJ/mol. This value represents the enthalpy of ionization for sodium ion (Na+), as it is the energy required to remove one electron from a neutral sodium atom to form a sodium ion.

Therefore, the enthalpy of ionization for sodium ion (Na+) is 495.8 kJ/mol.
