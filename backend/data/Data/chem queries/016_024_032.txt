Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
Calculate the standard enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction: 

AgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq) 

given that the standard enthalpies of formation for AgNO3(aq), NaCl(aq), AgCl(s), and NaNO3(aq) are -123.2 kJ/mol, -407.3 kJ/mol, -127.0 kJ/mol, and -467.3 kJ/mol, respectively.
To calculate the standard enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction, we can use the following equation:

ΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)

where ΔH_reaction is the standard enthalpy of precipitation, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

For the given reaction:

ΔH_reaction = [(-127.0 kJ/mol) + (-467.3 kJ/mol)] - [(-123.2 kJ/mol) + (-407.3 kJ/mol)]

ΔH_reaction = (-594.3 kJ/mol) - (-530.5 kJ/mol)

ΔH_reaction = -63.8 kJ/mol

The standard enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction is -63.8 kJ/mol.
