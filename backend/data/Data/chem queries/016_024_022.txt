Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
What is the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction between sodium chloride and silver nitrate, given that 50.0 mL of 0.200 M sodium chloride is mixed with 50.0 mL of 0.200 M silver nitrate at 25°C and the resulting mixture is allowed to reach equilibrium? The molar mass of sodium chloride is 58.44 g/mol and silver nitrate is 169.87 g/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction between sodium chloride (NaCl) and silver nitrate (AgNO3), we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:

NaCl (aq) + AgNO3 (aq) → AgCl (s) + NaNO3 (aq)

Next, we need to determine the limiting reactant. Since both solutions have the same concentration (0.200 M) and volume (50.0 mL), they will react in a 1:1 ratio according to the balanced equation. Therefore, neither reactant is in excess, and both are limiting reactants.

Now, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:

Moles of NaCl = (0.200 mol/L) * (50.0 mL) * (1 L/1000 mL) = 0.0100 mol
Moles of AgNO3 = (0.200 mol/L) * (50.0 mL) * (1 L/1000 mL) = 0.0100 mol

Since both reactants are limiting, 0.0100 mol of AgCl will precipitate out of the solution.

To find the enthalpy of precipitation, we need the enthalpy of formation for each compound involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpies of formation (∆Hf°) at 25°C are as follows:

NaCl (aq): -407.3 kJ/mol
AgNO3 (aq): -124.9 kJ/mol
AgCl (s): -127.0 kJ/mol
NaNO3 (aq): -365.6 kJ/mol

Using these values, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction (∆Hrxn) using the equation:

∆Hrxn = [∆Hf°(products) - ∆Hf°(reactants)]

∆Hrxn = [(1 mol AgCl * -127.0 kJ/mol) + (1 mol NaNO3 * -365.6 kJ/mol)] - [(1 mol NaCl * -407.3 kJ/mol) + (1 mol AgNO3 * -124.9 kJ/mol)]

∆Hrxn = (-127.0 - 365.6) - (-407.3 - 124.9)
∆Hrxn = -492.6 + 532.2
∆Hrxn = 39.6 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction between sodium chloride and silver nitrate is 39.6 kJ/mol.
