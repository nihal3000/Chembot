Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
What is the enthalpy change (in kJ/mol) for dissolving 5.00 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) in 100.0 mL of water? Given the molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol and the specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/(g°C), calculate the change in temperature of the water if the dissolution process is exothermic and releases 500 kJ of energy.
First, we need to determine the number of moles of NaCl in 5.00 grams.

moles of NaCl = mass / molar mass
moles of NaCl = 5.00 g / 58.44 g/mol
moles of NaCl = 0.0856 mol

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change per mole of NaCl.

enthalpy change = energy released / moles of NaCl
enthalpy change = 500 kJ / 0.0856 mol
enthalpy change = 5841.86 kJ/mol

Next, we need to determine the mass of water in the solution. Since the density of water is approximately 1 g/mL, the mass of 100.0 mL of water is 100.0 grams.

Now, we can calculate the change in temperature of the water using the specific heat capacity formula:

q = mcΔT

where q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Since the dissolution process is exothermic, the energy released is equal to the energy absorbed by the water:

q = 500 kJ * 1000 J/kJ = 500,000 J

Now, we can solve for ΔT:

ΔT = q / (mc)
ΔT = 500,000 J / (100.0 g * 4.184 J/(g°C))
ΔT = 500,000 J / 418.4 J/°C
ΔT = 1195.22 °C

The change in temperature of the water is 1195.22 °C.
