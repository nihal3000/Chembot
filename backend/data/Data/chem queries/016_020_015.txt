Enthalpy of desorption calculations
What is the enthalpy of desorption of water from a silica gel surface, given that the initial weight of the silica gel was 5 g, and after desorption, the weight decreased to 3.5 g? The specific heat capacity of silica gel is 0.5 J/g°C and the initial temperature was 25°C, while the final temperature was 40°C. Assume that the process is reversible and the pressure is constant at 1 atm.
To calculate the enthalpy of desorption of water from the silica gel surface, we first need to determine the amount of heat absorbed by the silica gel during the temperature change.

1. Calculate the mass of water desorbed:
Initial mass of silica gel = 5 g
Final mass of silica gel = 3.5 g
Mass of water desorbed = 5 g - 3.5 g = 1.5 g

2. Calculate the heat absorbed by the silica gel:
Specific heat capacity of silica gel = 0.5 J/g°C
Initial temperature = 25°C
Final temperature = 40°C
Temperature change = 40°C - 25°C = 15°C

Heat absorbed by silica gel (q) = mass of silica gel × specific heat capacity × temperature change
q = 3.5 g × 0.5 J/g°C × 15°C = 26.25 J

3. Calculate the enthalpy of desorption per gram of water (ΔH):
Since the process is reversible and at constant pressure, the enthalpy change is equal to the heat absorbed by the silica gel.

ΔH = q / mass of water desorbed
ΔH = 26.25 J / 1.5 g = 17.5 J/g

The enthalpy of desorption of water from the silica gel surface is 17.5 J/g.
