Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of isomerization for the reaction of cyclopropane to propene given that the standard enthalpy of formation of cyclopropane is -119.1 kJ/mol and the standard enthalpy of formation of propene is -103.8 kJ/mol. Assume that the enthalpy change of vaporization for both compounds is negligible.
To calculate the enthalpy change of isomerization for the reaction of cyclopropane to propene, we can use the following equation:

ΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)

In this case, the reactant is cyclopropane and the product is propene. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) for cyclopropane is -119.1 kJ/mol, and for propene, it is -103.8 kJ/mol.

ΔH_reaction = [(-103.8 kJ/mol) * 1] - [(-119.1 kJ/mol) * 1]

ΔH_reaction = -103.8 kJ/mol + 119.1 kJ/mol

ΔH_reaction = 15.3 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change of isomerization for the reaction of cyclopropane to propene is 15.3 kJ/mol.
