Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of adsorption of 1 mole of hydrogen gas on the surface of activated charcoal from the given data:
- The heat of combustion of hydrogen gas at constant volume is -285.8 kJ/mol
- The heat of combustion of hydrogen gas at constant pressure is -241.8 kJ/mol
- The heat of vaporization of hydrogen gas at its boiling point (20.3 K) is 0.452 kJ/mol
- The surface area of activated charcoal is 500 m²/g
- The weight of activated charcoal used is 0.5 g.
To calculate the enthalpy of adsorption of hydrogen gas on the surface of activated charcoal, we need to consider the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas at constant pressure and the heat of vaporization of hydrogen gas at its boiling point. The heat of combustion at constant volume is not relevant to this problem.

First, let's find the number of moles of hydrogen gas that can be adsorbed on the surface of activated charcoal. The surface area of activated charcoal is 500 m²/g, and the weight of activated charcoal used is 0.5 g. Therefore, the total surface area of activated charcoal is:

Total surface area = (Surface area per gram) × (Weight of activated charcoal)
Total surface area = 500 m²/g × 0.5 g
Total surface area = 250 m²

Assuming that 1 mole of hydrogen gas can be adsorbed on 1 m² of activated charcoal surface area, the number of moles of hydrogen gas that can be adsorbed is:

Number of moles of H₂ = Total surface area
Number of moles of H₂ = 250 moles

Now, let's calculate the enthalpy change for the adsorption process. The enthalpy change for the adsorption process can be calculated as the difference between the heat of combustion at constant pressure and the heat of vaporization:

ΔH_adsorption = ΔH_combustion - ΔH_vaporization

We are given the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas at constant pressure as -241.8 kJ/mol and the heat of vaporization of hydrogen gas at its boiling point as 0.452 kJ/mol. Plugging these values into the equation:

ΔH_adsorption = (-241.8 kJ/mol) - (0.452 kJ/mol)
ΔH_adsorption = -242.252 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy of adsorption of 1 mole of hydrogen gas on the surface of activated charcoal is -242.252 kJ/mol.
