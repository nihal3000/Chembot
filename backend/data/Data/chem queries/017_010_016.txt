The photochemical properties of fluorescent dyes
How does the excitation wavelength affect the emission intensity and lifetime of a commonly used fluorescent dye such as fluorescein?
The excitation wavelength plays a significant role in the emission intensity and lifetime of a fluorescent dye like fluorescein. The excitation wavelength is the specific wavelength of light that is absorbed by the dye, causing its electrons to become excited and jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their ground state, they release energy in the form of emitted light, which is the fluorescence we observe.

1. Emission intensity: The excitation wavelength affects the emission intensity because the efficiency of the excitation process depends on how well the excitation light matches the absorption spectrum of the dye. When the excitation wavelength is close to the dye's maximum absorption wavelength (also known as the peak wavelength), the dye absorbs more photons, leading to a higher probability of fluorescence and thus a higher emission intensity. If the excitation wavelength is far from the peak wavelength, the dye absorbs fewer photons, resulting in lower emission intensity.

2. Fluorescence lifetime: The fluorescence lifetime is the average time it takes for the excited electrons to return to their ground state and emit a photon. The excitation wavelength can have an indirect effect on the fluorescence lifetime. When the excitation wavelength is close to the peak wavelength, more molecules are excited, and the probability of non-radiative processes (such as quenching or energy transfer) increases. These non-radiative processes can compete with the radiative (fluorescence) process, leading to a decrease in the fluorescence lifetime. On the other hand, if the excitation wavelength is far from the peak wavelength, fewer molecules are excited, and the probability of non-radiative processes decreases, which may result in a longer fluorescence lifetime.

In summary, the excitation wavelength affects the emission intensity and fluorescence lifetime of a dye like fluorescein by influencing the efficiency of the excitation process and the probability of non-radiative processes. To achieve optimal fluorescence, it is essential to choose an excitation wavelength that closely matches the dye's peak absorption wavelength.
