Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of dissolving 10.0 g of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 200.0 mL of water at 25°C. Given: the enthalpy of dissolution of NaOH is -44.5 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change of dissolving 10.0 g of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 200.0 mL of water at 25°C, we need to first determine the number of moles of NaOH being dissolved. 

The molar mass of NaOH is:
Na = 22.99 g/mol
O = 16.00 g/mol
H = 1.01 g/mol
Total = 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 40.00 g/mol

Now, we can calculate the number of moles of NaOH:
moles = mass / molar mass
moles = 10.0 g / 40.00 g/mol = 0.25 mol

Next, we can use the given enthalpy of dissolution to calculate the enthalpy change:
ΔH = moles × enthalpy of dissolution
ΔH = 0.25 mol × (-44.5 kJ/mol) = -11.125 kJ

Therefore, the enthalpy change of dissolving 10.0 g of sodium hydroxide in 200.0 mL of water at 25°C is -11.125 kJ.
