Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
What is the enthalpy change (in kJ/mol) for the isomerization of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene at 25°C and constant pressure of 1 atm, given that the heat of formation of cis-2-butene is -64.6 kJ/mol and the heat of formation of trans-2-butene is -63.9 kJ/mol?
To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the isomerization of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene, we can use the following equation:

ΔH = ΔHf (products) - ΔHf (reactants)

In this case, the reactant is cis-2-butene, and the product is trans-2-butene. The heat of formation (ΔHf) for cis-2-butene is -64.6 kJ/mol, and the heat of formation for trans-2-butene is -63.9 kJ/mol.

ΔH = (-63.9 kJ/mol) - (-64.6 kJ/mol)

ΔH = 0.7 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the isomerization of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene at 25°C and constant pressure of 1 atm is 0.7 kJ/mol.
