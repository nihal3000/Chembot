Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
What is the enthalpy of adsorption for the adsorption of nitrogen gas onto activated charcoal at a temperature of 25°C? The pressure of nitrogen gas is 1 atm, and the mass of the activated charcoal used is 2.5 g. The volume of the adsorption vessel is 500 mL, and the initial and final pressures of nitrogen gas inside the vessel are 1 atm and 0.5 atm, respectively. Use the following information to calculate the enthalpy of adsorption: 
- The heat capacity of the adsorption vessel is 12.5 J/(K mL)
- The heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/(g K) 
- The density of water is 1 g/mL
To calculate the enthalpy of adsorption, we first need to determine the amount of nitrogen gas adsorbed onto the activated charcoal. We can do this using the ideal gas law:

PV = nRT

where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm/(mol K)), and T is temperature in Kelvin.

1. Calculate the initial moles of nitrogen gas (n_initial):

P_initial = 1 atm
V = 0.5 L (converted from 500 mL)
T = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K

n_initial = (P_initial * V) / (R * T)
n_initial = (1 * 0.5) / (0.0821 * 298.15)
n_initial ≈ 0.0203 mol

2. Calculate the final moles of nitrogen gas (n_final):

P_final = 0.5 atm

n_final = (P_final * V) / (R * T)
n_final = (0.5 * 0.5) / (0.0821 * 298.15)
n_final ≈ 0.0101 mol

3. Calculate the moles of nitrogen gas adsorbed (Δn):

Δn = n_initial - n_final
Δn = 0.0203 - 0.0101
Δn ≈ 0.0102 mol

4. Calculate the heat released during the adsorption process (q):

q = -Δn * R * T
q = -0.0102 * 0.0821 * 298.15
q ≈ -25.0 J

5. Calculate the enthalpy of adsorption (ΔH_adsorption) per mole of nitrogen gas:

ΔH_adsorption = q / Δn
ΔH_adsorption = -25.0 J / 0.0102 mol
ΔH_adsorption ≈ -2450 J/mol

The enthalpy of adsorption for the adsorption of nitrogen gas onto activated charcoal at 25°C is approximately -2450 J/mol.
