Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Sure! Here's a question for the student to solve:

Given the heat of polymerization for the formation of polystyrene is -124 kJ/mol, calculate the enthalpy change for the polymerization of 30 grams of polystyrene. Assume that the molecular weight of polystyrene is 104.1 g/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the polymerization of 30 grams of polystyrene, we first need to determine the number of moles of polystyrene involved. We can do this using the molecular weight of polystyrene (104.1 g/mol).

Number of moles = mass / molecular weight
Number of moles = 30 g / 104.1 g/mol = 0.288 moles

Now that we have the number of moles, we can calculate the enthalpy change using the heat of polymerization (-124 kJ/mol).

Enthalpy change = heat of polymerization × number of moles
Enthalpy change = -124 kJ/mol × 0.288 moles = -35.7 kJ

Therefore, the enthalpy change for the polymerization of 30 grams of polystyrene is -35.7 kJ.
