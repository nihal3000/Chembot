Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose (C12H22O11) given the standard enthalpies of formation of sucrose, glucose, and fructose are -2220 kJ/mol, -1274 kJ/mol, and -915 kJ/mol respectively.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, we can use the following equation:

ΔH = ΣΔH(products) - ΣΔH(reactants)

The hydrolysis of sucrose can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation:

C12H22O11 + H2O → C6H12O6 (glucose) + C6H12O6 (fructose)

Now, we can plug in the given standard enthalpies of formation:

ΔH = [(-1274 kJ/mol) + (-915 kJ/mol)] - [(-2220 kJ/mol)]

ΔH = (-2189 kJ/mol) - (-2220 kJ/mol)

ΔH = 31 kJ/mol

Since we are calculating the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, we need to multiply the enthalpy change per mole by 2:

ΔH_total = 31 kJ/mol × 2 moles

ΔH_total = 62 kJ

Therefore, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose is 62 kJ.
