Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2, given that the heat of combustion of butene-1 and butene-2 are -2657.7 kJ/mol and -2674.4 kJ/mol, respectively.
To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2, we can use Hess's Law. According to Hess's Law, the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we can consider the combustion of butene-1 and butene-2 as two separate steps.

Step 1: Combustion of butene-1
Butene-1 + O2 → Combustion products
ΔH1 = -2657.7 kJ/mol

Step 2: Combustion of butene-2
Butene-2 + O2 → Combustion products
ΔH2 = -2674.4 kJ/mol

Now, we can use these two steps to calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2:

Step 3: Isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2
Butene-1 → Butene-2
ΔH3 = ?

According to Hess's Law, the sum of the enthalpy changes for steps 1 and 2 should be equal to the enthalpy change for step 3:

ΔH1 + ΔH2 = ΔH3

Since we want to find the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2 (ΔH3), we can rearrange the equation:

ΔH3 = ΔH2 - ΔH1

Now, we can plug in the values for ΔH1 and ΔH2:

ΔH3 = (-2674.4 kJ/mol) - (-2657.7 kJ/mol)

ΔH3 = -16.7 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2 is -16.7 kJ/mol.
