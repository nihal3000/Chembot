Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Sure, here's a question:

Calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene using the given bond dissociation energies: C-H = 413 kJ/mol, C=C = 602 kJ/mol, and H-H = 436 kJ/mol. Given that the standard enthalpy of formation for cis-2-butene is -127.0 kJ/mol, what is the standard enthalpy of formation for trans-2-butene?
To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene, we need to consider the bonds that are broken and formed during the process. In this case, one C-H bond is broken, and one H-H bond is formed. The enthalpy change can be calculated using the bond dissociation energies:

ΔH = Σ(bond energies of bonds broken) - Σ(bond energies of bonds formed)

In this case, the enthalpy change is:

ΔH = (1 × 413 kJ/mol) - (1 × 436 kJ/mol) = -23 kJ/mol

Now, we can use this enthalpy change to find the standard enthalpy of formation for trans-2-butene. The relationship between the standard enthalpies of formation for cis- and trans-2-butene is:

ΔHf(trans-2-butene) = ΔHf(cis-2-butene) + ΔH(isomerization)

Plugging in the values, we get:

ΔHf(trans-2-butene) = -127.0 kJ/mol + (-23 kJ/mol) = -150 kJ/mol

So, the standard enthalpy of formation for trans-2-butene is -150 kJ/mol.
