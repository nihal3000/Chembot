The mechanism of photochemical reactions in organic compounds
What is the mechanism for the photochemical reaction of benzophenone with methanol?
The photochemical reaction of benzophenone with methanol involves a series of steps that ultimately lead to the formation of a benzopinacol product. Here is the mechanism for this reaction:

1. Photoexcitation: Benzophenone absorbs a photon of light, which promotes an electron from its ground state to an excited state. This results in the formation of an excited singlet state of benzophenone (1Benzophenone*).

2. Intersystem crossing: The excited singlet state of benzophenone undergoes intersystem crossing, a process where the electron changes its spin multiplicity, to form a more stable and longer-lived triplet state (3Benzophenone*).

3. Hydrogen abstraction: The excited triplet state of benzophenone (3Benzophenone*) can abstract a hydrogen atom from methanol, generating a benzophenone ketyl radical (Benzophenone-H•) and a methoxy radical (•OCH3).

4. Radical recombination: The benzophenone ketyl radical (Benzophenone-H•) can react with another benzophenone ketyl radical or with another excited triplet state of benzophenone (3Benzophenone*) to form a C-C bond, resulting in the formation of benzopinacol.

Overall, the photochemical reaction of benzophenone with methanol results in the formation of benzopinacol through a series of steps involving photoexcitation, intersystem crossing, hydrogen abstraction, and radical recombination.
