Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the isomerization of 2-butene to 1-butene at constant pressure, given that the standard enthalpy of formation of 2-butene is -118.0 kJ/mol and the standard enthalpy of formation of 1-butene is -133.9 kJ/mol?
To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of 2-butene to 1-butene at constant pressure, we can use the following equation:

ΔH = ΔHf (products) - ΔHf (reactants)

In this case, the reactant is 2-butene and the product is 1-butene. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) for 2-butene is -118.0 kJ/mol and for 1-butene is -133.9 kJ/mol.

ΔH = (-133.9 kJ/mol) - (-118.0 kJ/mol)

ΔH = -133.9 + 118.0

ΔH = -15.9 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the isomerization of 2-butene to 1-butene at constant pressure is -15.9 kJ/mol.
