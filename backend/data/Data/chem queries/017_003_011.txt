The mechanism of photochemical reactions in organic compounds
What is the mechanism of the photochemical reaction between benzene and chlorine in the presence of sunlight?
The photochemical reaction between benzene and chlorine in the presence of sunlight is known as the photochlorination of benzene. This reaction involves the substitution of one hydrogen atom in the benzene ring with a chlorine atom. The mechanism of this reaction can be described in the following steps:

1. Initiation: In the presence of sunlight (UV light), the chlorine molecule (Cl2) absorbs energy and undergoes homolytic fission, resulting in the formation of two chlorine radicals (Cl•).

Cl2 + hν (sunlight) → 2 Cl•

2. Propagation: The chlorine radical generated in the initiation step reacts with the benzene molecule by attacking one of its hydrogen atoms. This leads to the formation of a benzene radical (C6H5•) and a molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl).

C6H6 + Cl• → C6H5• + HCl

Next, the benzene radical reacts with another chlorine molecule, resulting in the formation of chlorobenzene (C6H5Cl) and another chlorine radical.

C6H5• + Cl2 → C6H5Cl + Cl•

The overall propagation step can be summarized as:

C6H6 + Cl2 → C6H5Cl + HCl

3. Termination: The reaction can be terminated when two radicals react with each other, forming a stable molecule. This can occur in several ways, such as:

Cl• + Cl• → Cl2
C6H5• + Cl• → C6H5Cl
C6H5• + C6H5• → C6H5-C6H5 (biphenyl)

The main product of this reaction is chlorobenzene, but minor amounts of biphenyl and unreacted chlorine may also be formed during the termination step.
