Enthalpy of ionization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change (in kJ/mol) for the ionization of magnesium, given that the first ionization energy of magnesium is 738 kJ/mol and the second ionization energy is 1450 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the ionization of magnesium, we need to consider both the first and second ionization energies. The enthalpy change for the ionization of magnesium can be calculated by adding the first and second ionization energies together:

Enthalpy change = First ionization energy + Second ionization energy
Enthalpy change = 738 kJ/mol + 1450 kJ/mol
Enthalpy change = 2188 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the ionization of magnesium is 2188 kJ/mol.
