Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 0.025 moles of ethyl acetate (C4H8O2) in the presence of excess water, given that the enthalpy of reaction is -56.0 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 0.025 moles of ethyl acetate, we can use the following equation:

ΔH = moles × enthalpy of reaction

ΔH = 0.025 moles × (-56.0 kJ/mol)

ΔH = -1.4 kJ

The enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 0.025 moles of ethyl acetate is -1.4 kJ.
