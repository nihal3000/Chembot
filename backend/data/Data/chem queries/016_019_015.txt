Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of adsorption of hydrogen gas on activated carbon if 2 grams of activated carbon absorb 0.025 moles of hydrogen gas at 298 K and the pressure of the system is 1 atm. The molar enthalpy of hydrogen gas is -285.8 kJ/mol at constant pressure.
To calculate the enthalpy of adsorption of hydrogen gas on activated carbon, we can use the following equation:

ΔH_ads = ΔH_gas - ΔH_abs

where ΔH_ads is the enthalpy of adsorption, ΔH_gas is the molar enthalpy of hydrogen gas, and ΔH_abs is the enthalpy of absorption.

First, we need to calculate the enthalpy of absorption (ΔH_abs). We can use the ideal gas law to find the work done by the gas during the absorption process:

PV = nRT

where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.

Rearranging the equation to solve for V:

V = nRT / P

Plugging in the values:

V = (0.025 moles) * (8.314 J/mol·K) * (298 K) / (1 atm * 101.325 J/L·atm)

V ≈ 0.0614 L

Now, we can calculate the work done by the gas (W):

W = -PΔV

Since the gas is absorbed by the activated carbon, the final volume is 0, so ΔV = -0.0614 L. Plugging in the values:

W = -(1 atm * 101.325 J/L·atm) * (-0.0614 L)

W ≈ 6.22 J

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy of absorption (ΔH_abs):

ΔH_abs = ΔU + W

Since the process is isothermal (constant temperature), the change in internal energy (ΔU) is 0. Therefore:

ΔH_abs = 0 + 6.22 J

ΔH_abs ≈ 6.22 J

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy of adsorption (ΔH_ads):

ΔH_ads = ΔH_gas - ΔH_abs

The molar enthalpy of hydrogen gas is given as -285.8 kJ/mol, so for 0.025 moles, it is:

ΔH_gas = -285.8 kJ/mol * 0.025 moles = -7.145 kJ

Converting ΔH_abs to kJ:

ΔH_abs ≈ 6.22 J * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 0.00622 kJ

Now, we can find ΔH_ads:

ΔH_ads = -7.145 kJ - 0.00622 kJ

ΔH_ads ≈ -7.151 kJ

So, the enthalpy of adsorption of hydrogen gas on activated carbon is approximately -7.151 kJ.
