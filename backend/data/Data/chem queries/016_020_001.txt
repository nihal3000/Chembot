Enthalpy of desorption calculations
What is the enthalpy change of desorption for a sample of water molecules adsorbed onto a silica gel surface? Given that the mass of the silica gel is 2.0 g and the initial temperature of the system is 25°C. The final temperature of the system after the desorption process is complete is 90°C. The heat capacity of the silica gel is 0.70 J/g°C. Assume that the enthalpy of vaporization of water is 44.0 kJ/mol.
To find the enthalpy change of desorption for the water molecules, we first need to determine the amount of heat absorbed by the silica gel during the desorption process. We can do this using the formula:

q = mcΔT

where q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the silica gel, c is the heat capacity of the silica gel, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Given the mass of the silica gel (m) is 2.0 g, the heat capacity (c) is 0.70 J/g°C, and the change in temperature (ΔT) is (90°C - 25°C) = 65°C, we can calculate the heat absorbed:

q = (2.0 g) × (0.70 J/g°C) × (65°C) = 91 J

Now, we need to determine the number of moles of water molecules that were desorbed. To do this, we can use the enthalpy of vaporization of water (ΔHvap) and the heat absorbed by the silica gel:

ΔH = q = nΔHvap

where ΔH is the enthalpy change, n is the number of moles of water, and ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization of water.

Given the enthalpy of vaporization of water (ΔHvap) is 44.0 kJ/mol and the heat absorbed (q) is 91 J, we can calculate the number of moles of water:

n = q / ΔHvap = (91 J) / (44.0 kJ/mol × 1000 J/kJ) = 2.068 x 10^(-3) mol

Finally, we can calculate the enthalpy change of desorption (ΔH) for the water molecules:

ΔH = nΔHvap = (2.068 x 10^(-3) mol) × (44.0 kJ/mol) = 0.091 kJ

So, the enthalpy change of desorption for the water molecules adsorbed onto the silica gel surface is approximately 0.091 kJ.
