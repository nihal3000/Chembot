Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
What is the change in enthalpy (ΔH) when 3 moles of nitrogen gas (N₂) are adsorbed onto the surface of a solid adsorbent at a temperature of 25°C and a pressure of 1 atm? The initial pressure of nitrogen gas was 3 atm and a surface area of 10 m² was available for adsorption. Assume that the change in volume of nitrogen gas during adsorption is negligible and that the process is reversible and isothermal.
To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for this process, we can use the equation:

ΔH = ΔU + PΔV

where ΔU is the change in internal energy, P is the pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume. Since the process is isothermal and the change in volume is negligible, the change in internal energy (ΔU) is approximately zero. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

ΔH ≈ PΔV

Since the change in volume (ΔV) is negligible, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) is also approximately zero. This means that the enthalpy of the system remains constant during the adsorption process.
