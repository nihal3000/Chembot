Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
What is the standard enthalpy change of isomerization for the reaction of cis-but-2-ene to trans-but-2-ene if 25 g of the reactant is initially present at a temperature of 25°C and the reaction is carried out at constant pressure of 1 atm? Given that the heat capacity of the reaction mixture is 45 J/K and the molar mass of the reactant is 70 g/mol. (Assume ideal behavior and neglect any heat loss to the surroundings).
To find the standard enthalpy change of isomerization for the reaction of cis-but-2-ene to trans-but-2-ene, we first need to determine the number of moles of the reactant and the heat absorbed by the reaction mixture.

1. Calculate the number of moles of cis-but-2-ene:
moles = mass / molar mass
moles = 25 g / 70 g/mol
moles = 0.357 mol

2. Calculate the heat absorbed by the reaction mixture:
Since the reaction is carried out at constant pressure, the heat absorbed (q) is equal to the enthalpy change (ΔH) of the reaction.

q = ΔH = n * C * ΔT

where n is the number of moles, C is the heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature. However, we are not given the change in temperature, so we cannot directly calculate the enthalpy change.

In this case, we need more information to determine the standard enthalpy change of isomerization for the reaction of cis-but-2-ene to trans-but-2-ene. Specifically, we need either the change in temperature (ΔT) or the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction.
