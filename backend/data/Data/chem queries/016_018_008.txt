Enthalpy of ionization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change required to ionize 2 moles of magnesium atoms to form Mg2+ ions, given that the first ionization energy of magnesium is 737 kJ/mol and the second ionization energy is 1450 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change required to ionize 2 moles of magnesium atoms to form Mg2+ ions, we need to consider both the first and second ionization energies.

First ionization energy is the energy required to remove one electron from each atom in 1 mole of gaseous atoms to form 1 mole of gaseous 1+ ions. In this case, the first ionization energy of magnesium is 737 kJ/mol.

Second ionization energy is the energy required to remove one electron from each atom in 1 mole of gaseous 1+ ions to form 1 mole of gaseous 2+ ions. In this case, the second ionization energy of magnesium is 1450 kJ/mol.

To ionize 2 moles of magnesium atoms to form Mg2+ ions, we need to consider both ionization energies for 2 moles:

Enthalpy change for first ionization of 2 moles of Mg:
ΔH1 = (first ionization energy) × (number of moles)
ΔH1 = 737 kJ/mol × 2 moles = 1474 kJ

Enthalpy change for second ionization of 2 moles of Mg:
ΔH2 = (second ionization energy) × (number of moles)
ΔH2 = 1450 kJ/mol × 2 moles = 2900 kJ

Total enthalpy change for ionizing 2 moles of Mg to Mg2+ ions:
ΔH_total = ΔH1 + ΔH2
ΔH_total = 1474 kJ + 2900 kJ = 4374 kJ

Therefore, the enthalpy change required to ionize 2 moles of magnesium atoms to form Mg2+ ions is 4374 kJ.
