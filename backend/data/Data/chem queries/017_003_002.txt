The mechanism of photochemical reactions in organic compounds
How does the mechanism of photochemical reactions differ in alkenes and alkanes when exposed to UV light?
When exposed to UV light, alkenes and alkanes undergo different photochemical reactions due to the differences in their molecular structures and bonding.

1. Alkanes:
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons with single bonds between carbon atoms (C-C). When exposed to UV light, alkanes primarily undergo a process called homolytic cleavage. In this process, the UV light provides enough energy to break the C-H bond, generating two free radicals (one hydrogen radical and one alkyl radical). These radicals are highly reactive and can further react with other molecules or radicals to form new products. The most common photochemical reactions in alkanes are:

a) Chlorination: The alkyl radical reacts with a chlorine molecule (Cl2), forming a chloroalkane and a chlorine radical. The chlorine radical can then react with another alkane molecule, propagating the chain reaction.

b) Hydrogen abstraction: The alkyl radical can abstract a hydrogen atom from another alkane molecule, forming a new alkane and a new alkyl radical.

2. Alkenes:
Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). When exposed to UV light, alkenes can undergo a variety of photochemical reactions, the most common being:

a) Cis-trans isomerization: The UV light can cause the rotation around the double bond, converting a cis-alkene to a trans-alkene or vice versa. This process is called photoisomerization.

b) [2+2] Cycloaddition: Two alkenes can react with each other in the presence of UV light, forming a four-membered cyclic compound called a cyclobutane. This reaction is also known as the Paternò-Büchi reaction.

c) Norrish Type I and Type II reactions: These reactions involve the cleavage of bonds in carbonyl-containing alkenes, leading to the formation of radicals or biradicals that can further react to form various products.

In summary, the mechanism of photochemical reactions in alkenes and alkanes differs due to the nature of their molecular structures and bonding. Alkanes primarily undergo homolytic cleavage, generating radicals that can react with other molecules, while alkenes can undergo a variety of reactions, including isomerization, cycloaddition, and bond cleavage in carbonyl-containing compounds.
