Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change when 2 moles of nitrogen gas are adsorbed onto the surface of activated charcoal at a temperature of 298 K, given that the pressure of nitrogen is 1 atm and the final pressure of nitrogen adsorbed is 0.5 atm. The standard enthalpy of formation of nitrogen gas is 0 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the adsorption of nitrogen gas onto activated charcoal, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the change in pressure to the change in enthalpy and temperature. The equation is as follows:

ln(P2/P1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

In this case, we have the initial pressure (P1) as 1 atm, the final pressure (P2) as 0.5 atm, and the temperature (T1 and T2) as 298 K. The gas constant (R) is 8.314 J/mol*K. Since the process occurs at constant temperature, T1 = T2, and the equation simplifies to:

ln(P2/P1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T - 1/T)

ln(0.5) = -ΔH / (8.314 J/mol*K)

Now, we can solve for ΔH:

ΔH = -8.314 J/mol*K * ln(0.5)
ΔH ≈ 5774 J/mol

Since we have 2 moles of nitrogen gas, the total enthalpy change for the adsorption process is:

Total ΔH = 2 * 5774 J/mol
Total ΔH ≈ 11548 J

Therefore, the enthalpy change when 2 moles of nitrogen gas are adsorbed onto the surface of activated charcoal at a temperature of 298 K is approximately 11.548 kJ.
