Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of isomerization for the conversion of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene, given that the heat of combustion of cis-2-butene is -3283.1 kJ/mol and the heat of combustion of trans-2-butene is -3336.8 kJ/mol. Assume that the heat of combustion is representative of the enthalpy of formation.
To calculate the enthalpy change of isomerization for the conversion of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene, we can use the following equation:

ΔH_isomerization = ΔH_f(trans-2-butene) - ΔH_f(cis-2-butene)

Since the heat of combustion is representative of the enthalpy of formation, we can use the given values:

ΔH_isomerization = (-3336.8 kJ/mol) - (-3283.1 kJ/mol)

ΔH_isomerization = -53.7 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change of isomerization for the conversion of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene is -53.7 kJ/mol.
