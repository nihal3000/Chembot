Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
What is the enthalpy change of dissolving 5 grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 100 mL of water at 25°C? Given the molar enthalpy of dissolution for NaOH is -44.5 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaOH in 5 grams.

The molar mass of NaOH is:
Na = 22.99 g/mol
O = 16.00 g/mol
H = 1.01 g/mol
Total = 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 40.00 g/mol

Now, we can find the number of moles of NaOH in 5 grams:
moles = mass / molar mass
moles = 5 g / 40.00 g/mol = 0.125 mol

Now, we can use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to find the enthalpy change:
enthalpy change = moles × molar enthalpy of dissolution
enthalpy change = 0.125 mol × (-44.5 kJ/mol) = -5.5625 kJ

The enthalpy change of dissolving 5 grams of sodium hydroxide in 100 mL of water at 25°C is -5.5625 kJ.
