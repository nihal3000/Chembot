Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
What is the change in enthalpy for the polymerization reaction of 1,3-butadiene to form polybutadiene? Given:

- The enthalpy change for the combustion of 1,3-butadiene is -2672.8 kJ/mol
- The mole fraction of 1,3-butadiene in the polymerization reaction is 0.5
- The reaction produces one mole of product
To calculate the change in enthalpy for the polymerization reaction of 1,3-butadiene to form polybutadiene, we can use the following equation:

ΔH_polymerization = ΔH_combustion * mole_fraction

where ΔH_polymerization is the enthalpy change for the polymerization reaction, ΔH_combustion is the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1,3-butadiene, and mole_fraction is the mole fraction of 1,3-butadiene in the polymerization reaction.

Given the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1,3-butadiene is -2672.8 kJ/mol and the mole fraction of 1,3-butadiene in the polymerization reaction is 0.5, we can calculate the change in enthalpy for the polymerization reaction:

ΔH_polymerization = (-2672.8 kJ/mol) * 0.5

ΔH_polymerization = -1336.4 kJ/mol

Therefore, the change in enthalpy for the polymerization reaction of 1,3-butadiene to form polybutadiene is -1336.4 kJ/mol.
