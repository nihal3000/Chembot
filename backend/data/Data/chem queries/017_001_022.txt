The effect of light intensity on the rate of photochemical reactions
How does the rate of a photochemical reaction change as the intensity of light is increased?
The rate of a photochemical reaction is directly proportional to the intensity of light. As the intensity of light increases, the rate of the photochemical reaction also increases. This relationship can be explained by the fact that photochemical reactions are initiated by the absorption of light energy by molecules. When the light intensity is higher, more photons are available to interact with the molecules, leading to a higher probability of absorption and subsequent reaction.

However, this relationship may not always be linear, especially at very high light intensities. At high intensities, the reaction rate may reach a saturation point where all the molecules capable of absorbing photons have done so, and no further increase in reaction rate is observed. Additionally, very high light intensities can sometimes lead to the formation of side products or degradation of reactants, which can alter the overall reaction rate.
