Enthalpy of desorption calculations
What is the enthalpy of desorption for hydrogen gas from a catalyst surface, given that the initial temperature is 298 K and the final temperature after desorption is 350 K? The mass of the catalyst used is 2 grams and the moles of hydrogen gas desorbed is 0.1 moles. The heat capacity of the catalyst is 0.5 J/K per gram.
To calculate the enthalpy of desorption for hydrogen gas from the catalyst surface, we first need to find the heat absorbed by the catalyst during the process. We can use the formula:

q = mcΔT

where q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the catalyst, c is the heat capacity of the catalyst, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Given:
m = 2 grams
c = 0.5 J/K per gram
ΔT = 350 K - 298 K = 52 K

Now, we can calculate the heat absorbed by the catalyst:

q = (2 grams) × (0.5 J/K per gram) × (52 K) = 52 J

Since the catalyst absorbs 52 J of heat during the desorption process, this means that the hydrogen gas releases 52 J of heat as it desorbs from the catalyst surface. The enthalpy of desorption (ΔH) is the heat released per mole of hydrogen gas desorbed. We can calculate this by dividing the heat released by the moles of hydrogen gas desorbed:

ΔH = q / n

where n is the moles of hydrogen gas desorbed.

Given:
n = 0.1 moles

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy of desorption:

ΔH = (52 J) / (0.1 moles) = 520 J/mol

The enthalpy of desorption for hydrogen gas from the catalyst surface is 520 J/mol.
