Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
What is the enthalpy change when 50 grams of potassium chloride (KCl) dissolve in 200 ml of water at a temperature of 25°C? The molar enthalpy of dissolution of KCl is -17.8 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change when 50 grams of potassium chloride (KCl) dissolve in 200 ml of water, we need to determine the number of moles of KCl and then use the molar enthalpy of dissolution.

First, let's find the number of moles of KCl:

Molar mass of KCl = 39.1 g/mol (for K) + 35.5 g/mol (for Cl) = 74.6 g/mol

Number of moles = mass / molar mass
Number of moles = 50 g / 74.6 g/mol = 0.670 moles

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change using the molar enthalpy of dissolution:

Enthalpy change = number of moles × molar enthalpy of dissolution
Enthalpy change = 0.670 moles × (-17.8 kJ/mol)
Enthalpy change = -11.93 kJ

The enthalpy change when 50 grams of potassium chloride dissolve in 200 ml of water at a temperature of 25°C is approximately -11.93 kJ.
