Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
What is the enthalpy change of the hydrolysis of acetic anhydride, given that 5 grams of acetic anhydride react with excess water to produce 2.2 grams of acetic acid and 2.5 grams of another product, and the heat of combustion of acetic acid is -871 kJ/mol?
To determine the enthalpy change of the hydrolysis of acetic anhydride, we need to first find the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. The reaction is as follows:

(CH3CO)2O + H2O â†’ CH3COOH + CH3COOH

Now, we need to find the moles of acetic anhydride, acetic acid, and the other product (which is also acetic acid in this case) involved in the reaction.

The molar mass of acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) is:
(4 * 12.01) + (6 * 1.01) + (3 * 16.00) = 102.09 g/mol

The molar mass of acetic acid (C2H4O2) is:
(2 * 12.01) + (4 * 1.01) + (2 * 16.00) = 60.05 g/mol

Now, we can find the moles of each substance:

Moles of acetic anhydride = 5 g / 102.09 g/mol = 0.0489 mol
Moles of acetic acid = 2.2 g / 60.05 g/mol = 0.0366 mol

Since the balanced equation shows that 1 mole of acetic anhydride reacts to produce 2 moles of acetic acid, we can find the moles of acetic acid produced from the reaction:

Moles of acetic acid produced = 0.0489 mol * 2 = 0.0978 mol

Now, we can find the enthalpy change of the reaction using the heat of combustion of acetic acid:

Enthalpy change = moles of acetic acid produced * heat of combustion of acetic acid
Enthalpy change = 0.0978 mol * -871 kJ/mol = -85.2 kJ

Therefore, the enthalpy change of the hydrolysis of acetic anhydride is -85.2 kJ.
