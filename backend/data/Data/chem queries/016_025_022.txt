Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
What is the enthalpy change when 50.0 g of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissolves in 500.0 mL of water at a constant temperature of 25°C, given that the density of water at this temperature is 0.997 g/mL and the molar enthalpy of dissolution for NaOH is -44.51 kJ/mol?
To calculate the enthalpy change, we first need to determine the number of moles of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) that are being dissolved. The molar mass of NaOH is approximately 40.0 g/mol (23.0 g/mol for Na, 16.0 g/mol for O, and 1.0 g/mol for H).

Number of moles of NaOH = (mass of NaOH) / (molar mass of NaOH)
Number of moles of NaOH = (50.0 g) / (40.0 g/mol)
Number of moles of NaOH = 1.25 mol

Now that we have the number of moles of NaOH, we can calculate the enthalpy change using the molar enthalpy of dissolution.

Enthalpy change = (number of moles of NaOH) × (molar enthalpy of dissolution)
Enthalpy change = (1.25 mol) × (-44.51 kJ/mol)
Enthalpy change = -55.64 kJ

The enthalpy change when 50.0 g of sodium hydroxide dissolves in 500.0 mL of water at a constant temperature of 25°C is -55.64 kJ.
