Enthalpy of ionization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of ionization of magnesium if 4.8 g of magnesium reacts completely with hydrochloric acid to form 224 mL of hydrogen gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The heat released during the reaction is -412 kJ/mol.
First, we need to determine the number of moles of magnesium (Mg) and hydrogen gas (H2) involved in the reaction. 

The molar mass of magnesium is 24.31 g/mol. 

Moles of Mg = mass of Mg / molar mass of Mg
Moles of Mg = 4.8 g / 24.31 g/mol
Moles of Mg = 0.197 mol

At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L. 

Moles of H2 = volume of H2 / molar volume of H2
Moles of H2 = 224 mL / 22,400 mL/mol
Moles of H2 = 0.01 mol

The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid is:

Mg + 2HCl â†’ MgCl2 + H2

From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of Mg reacts with 1 mole of H2. Since we have 0.197 mol of Mg and 0.01 mol of H2, the limiting reactant is H2.

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy of ionization of magnesium using the heat released during the reaction (-412 kJ/mol) and the moles of the limiting reactant (H2).

Enthalpy of ionization of Mg = heat released / moles of limiting reactant
Enthalpy of ionization of Mg = -412 kJ/mol / 0.01 mol
Enthalpy of ionization of Mg = -41,200 kJ/mol

The enthalpy of ionization of magnesium is -41,200 kJ/mol.
