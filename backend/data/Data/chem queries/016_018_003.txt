Enthalpy of ionization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the ionization of magnesium using the following information: 
- The first ionization energy of magnesium is 738 kJ/mol. 
- The second ionization energy of magnesium is 1450 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the ionization of magnesium, we need to consider both the first and second ionization energies. The enthalpy change for the ionization process is the sum of the first and second ionization energies.

Enthalpy change = First ionization energy + Second ionization energy

Enthalpy change = 738 kJ/mol + 1450 kJ/mol

Enthalpy change = 2188 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the ionization of magnesium is 2188 kJ/mol.
