Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10.0 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) in 100 mL of water at 25째C. The density of water is 1.00 g/mL and the heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g째C. The molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol and its enthalpy of dissolution is -3.9 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10.0 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) in 100 mL of water at 25째C, we will first determine the number of moles of NaCl and then use the enthalpy of dissolution to find the total enthalpy change.

1. Calculate the number of moles of NaCl:
moles of NaCl = mass of NaCl / molar mass of NaCl
moles of NaCl = 10.0 g / 58.44 g/mol
moles of NaCl = 0.171 mol

2. Calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaCl:
enthalpy change = moles of NaCl * enthalpy of dissolution
enthalpy change = 0.171 mol * (-3.9 kJ/mol)
enthalpy change = -0.667 kJ

The enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10.0 grams of sodium chloride in 100 mL of water at 25째C is -0.667 kJ.
