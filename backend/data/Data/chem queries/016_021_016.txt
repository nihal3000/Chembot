Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change (in kJ/mol) for the polymerization of ethylene to polyethylene, given that the polymerization of 1 mole of ethylene produces 3 moles of polyethylene and the enthalpy change of the reaction is -32 kJ/mol.
The given information is incorrect. The polymerization of ethylene (C2H4) to polyethylene (n[C2H4]) does not produce 3 moles of polyethylene from 1 mole of ethylene. Instead, it involves the formation of a long chain of ethylene units (n moles of ethylene) to form a single polyethylene molecule.

The correct way to represent the polymerization reaction is:

n C2H4 → [-CH2-CH2-]n

where n is the number of ethylene units in the polyethylene chain.

If the enthalpy change for the polymerization of 1 mole of ethylene is -32 kJ/mol, then the enthalpy change for the polymerization of n moles of ethylene would be:

ΔH = -32 kJ/mol * n

Since the enthalpy change is given per mole of ethylene, the enthalpy change for the polymerization of ethylene to polyethylene remains -32 kJ/mol, regardless of the number of ethylene units in the polyethylene chain.
