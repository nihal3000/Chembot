Enthalpy of desorption calculations
What is the theoretical amount of heat required to desorb 5 grams of CO2 adsorbed on activated carbon if the enthalpy change for this process is -25 kJ/mol? (Assume complete desorption of CO2)
To calculate the theoretical amount of heat required to desorb 5 grams of CO2, we first need to determine the number of moles of CO2 present. The molar mass of CO2 is 12.01 g/mol (for carbon) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (for oxygen) = 44.01 g/mol.

Now, we can calculate the number of moles of CO2:
moles of CO2 = mass of CO2 / molar mass of CO2
moles of CO2 = 5 g / 44.01 g/mol = 0.1136 mol

Since the enthalpy change for the desorption process is -25 kJ/mol, the heat required to desorb CO2 is positive (since we need to supply heat to reverse the process). Therefore, the heat required is +25 kJ/mol.

Finally, we can calculate the theoretical amount of heat required to desorb 5 grams of CO2:
Heat required = moles of CO2 * enthalpy change per mole
Heat required = 0.1136 mol * 25 kJ/mol = 2.84 kJ

So, the theoretical amount of heat required to desorb 5 grams of CO2 adsorbed on activated carbon is 2.84 kJ.
