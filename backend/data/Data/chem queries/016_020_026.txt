Enthalpy of desorption calculations
What is the enthalpy of desorption of water from a silica gel surface if the temperature is 25°C and the water vapor pressure is 10 torr? The initial weight of the silica gel was 5 g and after the desorption process it reduced to 4.5 g. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol and the surface area of the silica gel is 10 cm². Assume the desorption process is isothermal and reversible.
To calculate the enthalpy of desorption of water from the silica gel surface, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and enthalpy of vaporization:

ln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

In this case, we have the following information:

- P2 is the vapor pressure of water at 25°C (10 torr)
- P1 is the vapor pressure of water at 0°C (we can use the value of 4.58 torr)
- ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization of water (40.79 kJ/mol)
- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)
- T1 is the initial temperature (273.15 K)
- T2 is the final temperature (273.15 + 25 = 298.15 K)

First, we need to convert the vapor pressures from torr to Pa:

P2 = 10 torr * 101325 Pa / 760 torr = 1333.22 Pa
P1 = 4.58 torr * 101325 Pa / 760 torr = 612.57 Pa

Now we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(1333.22/612.57) = -ΔHvap / 8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/273.15)

Solving for ΔHvap:

ΔHvap = -8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/273.15) * ln(1333.22/612.57)
ΔHvap = -8.314 * (-0.000123) * 0.783
ΔHvap = 0.798 kJ/mol

Now we need to find the number of moles of water desorbed from the silica gel:

Δmass = 5 g - 4.5 g = 0.5 g
moles = 0.5 g / 18.015 g/mol = 0.0278 mol

Finally, we can calculate the total enthalpy of desorption:

ΔH_total = ΔHvap * moles
ΔH_total = 0.798 kJ/mol * 0.0278 mol
ΔH_total = 0.0222 kJ

So, the enthalpy of desorption of water from the silica gel surface is approximately 0.0222 kJ.
