Enthalpy of desorption calculations
What is the enthalpy of desorption for ammonia molecules adsorbed on the surface of activated carbon, given that the temperature is 298 K and the pressure is 1 atm? The initial and final states of the ammonia molecule need to be specified.
To determine the enthalpy of desorption for ammonia molecules adsorbed on the surface of activated carbon, we need to know the initial and final states of the ammonia molecule and the specific enthalpy values associated with these states.

Initial state: Ammonia molecules are adsorbed on the surface of activated carbon. This state is characterized by a specific enthalpy value, H_initial.

Final state: Ammonia molecules are desorbed from the surface of activated carbon and are in the gas phase. This state is characterized by a specific enthalpy value, H_final.

Enthalpy of desorption (ΔH_desorption) is the difference between the enthalpy values of the final and initial states:

ΔH_desorption = H_final - H_initial

Unfortunately, without the specific enthalpy values for the initial and final states, we cannot calculate the enthalpy of desorption directly. These values are typically determined experimentally or through computational simulations.

However, if you have access to the specific enthalpy values for the initial and final states, you can use the formula above to calculate the enthalpy of desorption for ammonia molecules adsorbed on the surface of activated carbon at 298 K and 1 atm.
