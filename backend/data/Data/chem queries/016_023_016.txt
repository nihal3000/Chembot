Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose (C12H22O11) into glucose (C6H12O6) and fructose (C6H12O6), given the enthalpy change of hydrolysis for glucose and fructose are -2801 and -2802 kJ/mol respectively.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, we first need to determine the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 1 mole of sucrose. The balanced chemical equation for the hydrolysis of sucrose is:

C12H22O11 + H2O → C6H12O6 (glucose) + C6H12O6 (fructose)

Since the enthalpy change of hydrolysis for glucose and fructose are -2801 and -2802 kJ/mol respectively, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 1 mole of sucrose by adding the enthalpy changes for glucose and fructose:

ΔH1 = ΔH(glucose) + ΔH(fructose)
ΔH1 = -2801 kJ/mol + (-2802 kJ/mol)
ΔH1 = -5603 kJ/mol

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose:

ΔH2 = 2 * ΔH1
ΔH2 = 2 * (-5603 kJ/mol)
ΔH2 = -11206 kJ

Therefore, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose is -11206 kJ.
