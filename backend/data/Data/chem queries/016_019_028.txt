Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
What is the enthalpy of adsorption for the adsorption of chlorine gas onto activated carbon at 298 K? Given that the initial pressure of chlorine gas is 1 atm, and the final pressure after adsorption is 0.5 atm. The mass of activated carbon used was 2 g. The molar mass of chlorine gas is 70.9 g/mol, and the density of activated carbon is 2.2 g/cm³. Assume the process is isothermic and adsorption is reversible.
To calculate the enthalpy of adsorption, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P1/P2) = (ΔH/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1)

where P1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures, ΔH is the enthalpy of adsorption, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures. Since the process is isothermic, T1 = T2 = 298 K.

First, we need to find the amount of chlorine gas adsorbed. We can do this by calculating the difference in moles of chlorine gas before and after adsorption.

Initial moles of chlorine gas (n1) = (Pressure × Volume) / (R × T)

Final moles of chlorine gas (n2) = (Pressure × Volume) / (R × T)

To find the volume, we can use the mass and density of activated carbon:

Volume = Mass / Density
Volume = 2 g / (2.2 g/cm³) = 0.909 cm³

Now, we need to convert the volume to liters:

Volume = 0.909 cm³ × (1 L / 1000 cm³) = 0.000909 L

Now we can find the initial and final moles of chlorine gas:

n1 = (1 atm × 0.000909 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K × 298 K) = 3.71 × 10⁻⁵ mol
n2 = (0.5 atm × 0.000909 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K × 298 K) = 1.85 × 10⁻⁵ mol

The difference in moles of chlorine gas (Δn) is the amount adsorbed:

Δn = n1 - n2 = 3.71 × 10⁻⁵ mol - 1.85 × 10⁻⁵ mol = 1.86 × 10⁻⁵ mol

Now we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the enthalpy of adsorption:

ln(P1/P2) = (ΔH/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1)

ln(1 atm / 0.5 atm) = (ΔH / 8.314 J/mol·K)(1/298 K - 1/298 K)

ln(2) = ΔH / (8.314 J/mol·K × 298 K)

ΔH = ln(2) × 8.314 J/mol·K × 298 K = 1716 J/mol

The enthalpy of adsorption for the adsorption of chlorine gas onto activated carbon at 298 K is approximately 1716 J/mol.
