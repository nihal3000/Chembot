Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the precipitation of 50.0 mL of 0.250 M silver nitrate solution reacting with excess sodium chloride solution to form silver chloride precipitate and sodium nitrate solution? The molar heat of solution for silver nitrate is -21.6 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of formation of solid silver chloride is -127.0 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we first need to determine the number of moles of silver nitrate (AgNO3) reacting and then use the molar heat of solution and enthalpy of formation values given.

1. Calculate the moles of AgNO3:
moles = Molarity × Volume (in L)
moles = 0.250 mol/L × 0.050 L
moles = 0.0125 mol AgNO3

2. Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:
AgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq)

From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of AgNO3 reacts with 1 mole of NaCl to form 1 mole of AgCl and 1 mole of NaNO3.

3. Calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of AgNO3:
Enthalpy change = moles × molar heat of solution
Enthalpy change = 0.0125 mol × (-21.6 kJ/mol)
Enthalpy change = -0.27 kJ

4. Calculate the enthalpy change for the formation of AgCl:
Enthalpy change = moles × enthalpy of formation
Enthalpy change = 0.0125 mol × (-127.0 kJ/mol)
Enthalpy change = -1.5875 kJ

5. Calculate the total enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction:
Total enthalpy change = Enthalpy change for dissolution + Enthalpy change for formation
Total enthalpy change = -0.27 kJ + (-1.5875 kJ)
Total enthalpy change = -1.8575 kJ

The enthalpy change for the precipitation of 50.0 mL of 0.250 M silver nitrate solution reacting with excess sodium chloride solution is approximately -1.86 kJ.
