Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the amount of heat required to polymerize 2 moles of styrene into polystyrene given the following information:
The enthalpy of polymerization for styrene is -56 kJ/mol and the reaction is exothermic.
To calculate the amount of heat required to polymerize 2 moles of styrene into polystyrene, we can use the following formula:

Heat (q) = moles (n) × enthalpy of polymerization (ΔH)

Given that the enthalpy of polymerization for styrene is -56 kJ/mol and the reaction is exothermic, the heat released during the polymerization of 1 mole of styrene is 56 kJ.

Now, we can calculate the heat required to polymerize 2 moles of styrene:

q = 2 moles × (-56 kJ/mol)

q = -112 kJ

Since the reaction is exothermic, the negative sign indicates that the heat is released during the polymerization process. Therefore, 112 kJ of heat is released when 2 moles of styrene are polymerized into polystyrene.
