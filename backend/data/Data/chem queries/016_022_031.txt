Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
What is the enthalpy change of isomerization for butene-1 to butene-2 given the following information:

- The standard enthalpy of formation for butene-1 is -24.7 kJ/mol
- The standard enthalpy of formation for butene-2 is -25.8 kJ/mol
To calculate the enthalpy change of isomerization for butene-1 to butene-2, we can use the following formula:

ΔH_isomerization = ΔH_f(butene-2) - ΔH_f(butene-1)

Where:
ΔH_isomerization = enthalpy change of isomerization
ΔH_f(butene-1) = standard enthalpy of formation for butene-1
ΔH_f(butene-2) = standard enthalpy of formation for butene-2

Plugging in the given values:

ΔH_isomerization = (-25.8 kJ/mol) - (-24.7 kJ/mol)

ΔH_isomerization = -1.1 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change of isomerization for butene-1 to butene-2 is -1.1 kJ/mol.
