Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
What is the enthalpy change of isomerization for cyclohexene to its cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexene isomer, given that the standard enthalpy of formation for cyclohexene is -39.0 kJ/mol and for cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexene it is -133.0 kJ/mol?
To find the enthalpy change of isomerization, we can use the following equation:

ΔH_isomerization = ΔH_f (product) - ΔH_f (reactant)

where ΔH_f is the standard enthalpy of formation.

In this case, the reactant is cyclohexene and the product is cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexene. We are given their standard enthalpies of formation:

ΔH_f (cyclohexene) = -39.0 kJ/mol
ΔH_f (cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexene) = -133.0 kJ/mol

Now, we can plug these values into the equation:

ΔH_isomerization = (-133.0 kJ/mol) - (-39.0 kJ/mol)

ΔH_isomerization = -94.0 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy change of isomerization for cyclohexene to its cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexene isomer is -94.0 kJ/mol.
