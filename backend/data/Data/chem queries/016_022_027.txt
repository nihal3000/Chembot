Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of n-butane to iso-butane if the standard enthalpy of formation for n-butane is -125.7 kJ/mol and that for iso-butane is -147.4 kJ/mol. The isomerization reaction occurs at a constant pressure of 1 atm and at a temperature of 298 K.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of n-butane to iso-butane, we can use the following equation:

ΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)

For the isomerization reaction, the reactant is n-butane and the product is iso-butane. The given standard enthalpies of formation are:

ΔH_f(n-butane) = -125.7 kJ/mol
ΔH_f(iso-butane) = -147.4 kJ/mol

Now, we can plug these values into the equation:

ΔH_reaction = [ΔH_f(iso-butane)] - [ΔH_f(n-butane)]
ΔH_reaction = (-147.4 kJ/mol) - (-125.7 kJ/mol)

ΔH_reaction = -147.4 + 125.7
ΔH_reaction = -21.7 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the isomerization of n-butane to iso-butane is -21.7 kJ/mol.
