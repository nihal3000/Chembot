Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction of ethylene, given that the enthalpy of combustion of ethylene is -1411.1 kJ/mol and that the polymerization of ethylene releases 3.4 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction of ethylene, we can use the following equation:

ΔH_polymerization = ΔH_combustion - ΔH_released

where ΔH_polymerization is the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction, ΔH_combustion is the enthalpy of combustion of ethylene, and ΔH_released is the energy released during the polymerization process.

Given that the enthalpy of combustion of ethylene is -1411.1 kJ/mol and the polymerization of ethylene releases 3.4 kJ/mol, we can plug these values into the equation:

ΔH_polymerization = (-1411.1 kJ/mol) - (3.4 kJ/mol)

ΔH_polymerization = -1414.5 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction of ethylene is -1414.5 kJ/mol.
