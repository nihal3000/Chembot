Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
Calculate the heat (in kJ/mol) evolved when 1 mole of hydrogen gas is adsorbed on a surface if the enthalpy of adsorption for hydrogen is -30 kJ/mol.
When 1 mole of hydrogen gas is adsorbed on a surface, the enthalpy of adsorption is -30 kJ/mol. Since the enthalpy is negative, this means that the process is exothermic, and heat is evolved during the adsorption.

Therefore, the heat evolved when 1 mole of hydrogen gas is adsorbed on a surface is 30 kJ/mol.
