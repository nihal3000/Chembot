Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10g of NaCl in 100g of water, given that the initial and final temperatures are 25°C and 20°C respectively. The molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol and the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/(g°C).
To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaCl in water, we need to determine the heat absorbed or released by the water during the process. We can do this using the formula:

q = mcΔT

where q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

First, let's find the change in temperature:

ΔT = T_final - T_initial
ΔT = 20°C - 25°C
ΔT = -5°C

Now, we can calculate the heat absorbed or released by the water:

q = mcΔT
q = (100 g)(4.18 J/(g°C))(-5°C)
q = -2090 J

Since the heat absorbed by the water is negative, this means that the water released heat during the dissolution process. Therefore, the enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaCl in water is -2090 J.

However, this value is for the dissolution of 10g of NaCl. To find the enthalpy change per mole of NaCl, we need to convert the mass of NaCl to moles:

moles of NaCl = mass / molar mass
moles of NaCl = 10 g / 58.44 g/mol
moles of NaCl = 0.171 mol

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change per mole of NaCl:

ΔH = q / moles of NaCl
ΔH = -2090 J / 0.171 mol
ΔH = -12222 J/mol

The enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaCl in water is approximately -12.2 kJ/mol.
