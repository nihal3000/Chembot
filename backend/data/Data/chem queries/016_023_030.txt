Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 50 grams of sucrose (C12H22O11) when dissolved in 500 ml of water at 25°C. The molar mass of sucrose is 342.3 g/mol and the enthalpy change per mole of sucrose is -564.8 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 50 grams of sucrose, we first need to determine the number of moles of sucrose present in the solution. 

Moles of sucrose = mass of sucrose / molar mass of sucrose
Moles of sucrose = 50 g / 342.3 g/mol
Moles of sucrose ≈ 0.146 moles

Now that we have the number of moles of sucrose, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction using the given enthalpy change per mole of sucrose.

Enthalpy change = moles of sucrose × enthalpy change per mole of sucrose
Enthalpy change = 0.146 moles × (-564.8 kJ/mol)
Enthalpy change ≈ -82.47 kJ

The enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 50 grams of sucrose when dissolved in 500 ml of water at 25°C is approximately -82.47 kJ.
