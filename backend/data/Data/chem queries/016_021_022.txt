Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the polymerization of propylene to polypropylene, given the enthalpy of formation of propylene is -103.8 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of formation of polypropylene is -45.4 kJ/mol. Assume the reaction occurs at constant pressure and temperature.
To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the polymerization of propylene to polypropylene, we can use the following equation:

ΔH = Σ ΔH(products) - Σ ΔH(reactants)

In this case, the reactant is propylene and the product is polypropylene. The enthalpy of formation of propylene is given as -103.8 kJ/mol, and the enthalpy of formation of polypropylene is given as -45.4 kJ/mol.

Since the reaction involves the conversion of one mole of propylene to one mole of polypropylene, the equation becomes:

ΔH = (-45.4 kJ/mol) - (-103.8 kJ/mol)

ΔH = 58.4 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy change for the polymerization of propylene to polypropylene is 58.4 kJ/mol.
