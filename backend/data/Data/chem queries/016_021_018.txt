Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the polymerization of 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene (MBC) if 1 mole of MBC is polymerized in a perfectly insulated container at a constant temperature of 25¬∞C. The reaction equation for the polymerization of MBC is given as:

nC5H8 (MBC)  ‚Üí  (C5H8)ùëõ (Polymer)

Given the bond dissociation energies (in kJ/mol) for the following bonds:
C-C bond = 348
C-H bond = 413

Assume that the enthalpy change of vaporization of MBC is negligible.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the polymerization of 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene (MBC), we need to determine the number of bonds broken and formed during the reaction.

First, let's analyze the structure of MBC (C5H8). It has:
- 4 C-C single bonds
- 1 C=C double bond
- 8 C-H bonds

Now, let's analyze the structure of the polymer (C5H8)n. For every monomer unit in the polymer, there will be:
- 4 C-C single bonds
- 8 C-H bonds

Notice that the C=C double bond in the monomer is broken and converted into a C-C single bond when the polymer is formed. Therefore, for every monomer unit in the polymer, there is one C=C bond broken and one C-C bond formed.

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the polymerization of 1 mole of MBC:

ŒîH = [Bonds formed - Bonds broken] * Bond dissociation energy

ŒîH = [(1 C-C bond formed) - (1 C=C bond broken)] * Bond dissociation energy

Since the bond dissociation energy for a C-C bond is 348 kJ/mol and the bond dissociation energy for a C=C bond is approximately 2 * 348 kJ/mol (as it is a double bond), we can plug these values into the equation:

ŒîH = [(1 * 348) - (1 * 2 * 348)] kJ/mol

ŒîH = [348 - 696] kJ/mol

ŒîH = -348 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the polymerization of 1 mole of 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene (MBC) is -348 kJ/mol. This means that the reaction is exothermic, as energy is released during the polymerization process.
