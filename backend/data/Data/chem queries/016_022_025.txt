Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of isomerization for the conversion of n-butane to isobutane if the heat of combustion of n-butane is -2657.5 kJ/mol and the heat of combustion of isobutane is -2878.8 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change of isomerization for the conversion of n-butane to isobutane, we can use Hess's Law. According to Hess's Law, the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we can consider the isomerization as a two-step process:

1. Combustion of n-butane to form products (CO2 and H2O)
2. Formation of isobutane from the products

The enthalpy change of isomerization (ΔH_isomerization) can be calculated as follows:

ΔH_isomerization = ΔH_combustion(isobutane) - ΔH_combustion(n-butane)

where ΔH_combustion(isobutane) and ΔH_combustion(n-butane) are the heats of combustion of isobutane and n-butane, respectively.

Plugging in the given values:

ΔH_isomerization = (-2878.8 kJ/mol) - (-2657.5 kJ/mol)

ΔH_isomerization = -221.3 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change of isomerization for the conversion of n-butane to isobutane is -221.3 kJ/mol.
