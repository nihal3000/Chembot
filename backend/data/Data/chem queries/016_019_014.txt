Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of adsorption when 2.5 moles of nitrogen gas are adsorbed onto 10 g of activated charcoal at 298 K, given that the pressure of nitrogen gas is 1.0 atm. The molar mass of nitrogen is 28 g/mol, and the initial pressure of nitrogen is 0.5 atm.
To calculate the enthalpy change of adsorption, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the change in pressure and temperature to the enthalpy change of adsorption. The equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH_ads/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1)

where P1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures, T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures, ΔH_ads is the enthalpy change of adsorption, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).

In this case, the initial pressure P1 is 0.5 atm, the final pressure P2 is 1.0 atm, the initial and final temperatures are both 298 K, and we want to find ΔH_ads.

First, we need to convert the pressures from atm to Pa (Pascals) since the gas constant R is in J/mol·K. 

1 atm = 101325 Pa

P1 = 0.5 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 50662.5 Pa
P2 = 1.0 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 101325 Pa

Now we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(101325/50662.5) = -(ΔH_ads/8.314)(1/298 - 1/298)

Since the temperatures are the same, the term (1/T2 - 1/T1) becomes 0, and the equation simplifies to:

ln(101325/50662.5) = 0

This means that the enthalpy change of adsorption, ΔH_ads, is also 0. In this case, there is no enthalpy change when 2.5 moles of nitrogen gas are adsorbed onto 10 g of activated charcoal at 298 K.
