Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
What is the change in enthalpy when 10 grams of sucrose (C12H22O11) is hydrolyzed in aqueous solution to form glucose (C6H12O6) and fructose (C6H12O6) according to the following equation: 

C12H22O11 + H2O → C6H12O6 + C6H12O6 

Given the following enthalpies of formation: 

ΔHf°(C12H22O11) = -2220 kJ/mol 

ΔHf°(C6H12O6) = -1275 kJ/mol 

ΔHf°(H2O) = -286 kJ/mol
To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:

ΔH = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)

First, let's find the moles of sucrose in 10 grams:

Sucrose molar mass = 12(12.01) + 22(1.01) + 11(16.00) = 342.30 g/mol

moles of sucrose = 10 g / 342.30 g/mol = 0.0292 mol

Now, let's calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:

ΔH = [(1 mol C6H12O6 × -1275 kJ/mol) + (1 mol C6H12O6 × -1275 kJ/mol)] - [(1 mol C12H22O11 × -2220 kJ/mol) + (1 mol H2O × -286 kJ/mol)]

ΔH = (-1275 - 1275) - (-2220 - 286) = -2550 - (-2506) = -44 kJ/mol

Since we have 0.0292 mol of sucrose, the change in enthalpy for 10 grams of sucrose is:

ΔH = -44 kJ/mol × 0.0292 mol = -1.28 kJ

Therefore, the change in enthalpy when 10 grams of sucrose is hydrolyzed in aqueous solution to form glucose and fructose is -1.28 kJ.
