The mechanism of photochemical reactions in organic compounds
What are the differences in the photochemical reactions of alkenes and alkanes due to their electronic structures? How do these electronic differences affect the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions? Provide examples of photochemical reactions of alkanes and alkenes and discuss their mechanisms.
The differences in the photochemical reactions of alkenes and alkanes are primarily due to their distinct electronic structures. Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons with single bonds between carbon atoms, while alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The presence of the double bond in alkenes leads to unique electronic properties that affect their photochemical reactivity.

Electronic structure differences:

1. Alkenes have a π bond in addition to the σ bond, which results from the overlap of p orbitals perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. This π bond is weaker and more reactive than the σ bond, making alkenes more susceptible to photochemical reactions.

2. The presence of the π bond in alkenes leads to a higher electron density around the double bond, making them more susceptible to electrophilic attack and other reactions involving electron transfer.

3. Alkenes can undergo photochemical reactions involving the π bond, such as cis-trans isomerization and dimerization, which are not possible for alkanes.

Efficiency and selectivity:

The electronic differences between alkenes and alkanes affect the efficiency and selectivity of photochemical reactions. Alkenes generally undergo photochemical reactions more readily than alkanes due to the presence of the more reactive π bond. Additionally, the higher electron density around the double bond in alkenes allows for greater selectivity in reactions involving electrophilic attack or electron transfer.

Examples of photochemical reactions:

1. Alkanes: The most common photochemical reaction for alkanes is the homolytic cleavage of a C-H bond, producing a hydrogen atom and an alkyl radical. This reaction is typically initiated by the absorption of UV light. For example, methane (CH4) can undergo homolytic cleavage to form a methyl radical (CH3•) and a hydrogen atom (H•).

2. Alkenes: One example of a photochemical reaction involving alkenes is the cis-trans isomerization, where the geometric isomers of an alkene interconvert upon exposure to UV light. For instance, cis-2-butene can be converted to trans-2-butene through a photochemical reaction. Another example is the [2+2] cycloaddition reaction, where two alkenes combine to form a cyclobutane ring upon exposure to UV light.

Mechanisms:

1. Alkanes: In the homolytic cleavage of a C-H bond, the bond dissociates upon absorption of UV light, generating a pair of radicals. This process involves the promotion of an electron from the bonding σ orbital to an antibonding σ* orbital, weakening the C-H bond and ultimately leading to its cleavage.

2. Alkenes: In the cis-trans isomerization, the π bond of the alkene absorbs UV light, promoting an electron from the π bonding orbital to the π* antibonding orbital. This results in the formation of an excited state, which can undergo rotation around the C-C single bond, leading to the interconversion of cis and trans isomers. In the [2+2] cycloaddition reaction, two alkenes approach each other in a parallel orientation, and their π bonds overlap upon absorption of UV light. This leads to the formation of a new σ bond between the two alkenes and the creation of a cyclobutane ring.
