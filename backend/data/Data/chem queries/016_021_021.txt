Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of polymerization of styrene given that the enthalpy change for the addition of one mole of styrene is -32 kJ/mol and the polymerization involves the addition of 50 monomer units. Assume that all the enthalpy change is due to polymerization and the reaction is exothermic.
To calculate the enthalpy of polymerization of styrene, we need to consider the enthalpy change for the addition of one mole of styrene and the number of monomer units involved in the polymerization.

Given:
Enthalpy change for the addition of one mole of styrene = -32 kJ/mol
Number of monomer units involved in the polymerization = 50

Enthalpy of polymerization = (Enthalpy change for the addition of one mole of styrene) × (Number of monomer units involved in the polymerization)

Enthalpy of polymerization = (-32 kJ/mol) × (50)

Enthalpy of polymerization = -1600 kJ

The enthalpy of polymerization of styrene is -1600 kJ. Since the value is negative, the reaction is exothermic, as mentioned in the problem statement.
