Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the adsorption of 2.50 moles of methane gas on a zeolite catalyst supported by alumina, given that the temperature of the system decreases from 298 K to 288 K and the pressure is decreased from 100 atm to 75 atm. The initial and final volumes of the gas are 10.0 L and 8.00 L respectively, and the heat capacity of the system is 25 J/K.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the adsorption of methane gas on the zeolite catalyst, we need to consider both the work done on the system due to the change in volume and the heat absorbed or released due to the change in temperature.

First, let's calculate the work done on the system due to the change in volume. The work done (W) can be calculated using the formula:

W = -P_ext * ΔV

where P_ext is the external pressure and ΔV is the change in volume. Since the pressure is not constant, we will use the average pressure during the process:

P_avg = (P_initial + P_final) / 2
P_avg = (100 atm + 75 atm) / 2
P_avg = 87.5 atm

Now, we need to convert the pressure to the SI unit (Pascals) and the volume to the SI unit (cubic meters):

P_avg = 87.5 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 8865375 Pa

V_initial = 10.0 L * (1 m³ / 1000 L) = 0.01 m³
V_final = 8.00 L * (1 m³ / 1000 L) = 0.008 m³

ΔV = V_final - V_initial = 0.008 m³ - 0.01 m³ = -0.002 m³

Now, we can calculate the work done:

W = -P_avg * ΔV = -(-0.002 m³ * 8865375 Pa) = 17730.75 J

Next, let's calculate the heat absorbed or released due to the change in temperature. The heat (q) can be calculated using the formula:

q = C_p * ΔT

where C_p is the heat capacity of the system and ΔT is the change in temperature:

ΔT = T_final - T_initial = 288 K - 298 K = -10 K

q = 25 J/K * (-10 K) = -250 J

Finally, we can calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the adsorption process:

ΔH = q + W = -250 J + 17730.75 J = 17480.75 J

Therefore, the enthalpy change for the adsorption of 2.50 moles of methane gas on a zeolite catalyst supported by alumina is 17480.75 J.
