Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
What is the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction between 50 mL of 0.2 M AgNO3 and 50 mL of 0.2 M NaCl? Given that the final volume of the solution is 100 mL and the temperature remains constant at 25°C.
To calculate the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction between AgNO₃ and NaCl, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:

AgNO₃(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO₃(aq)

Next, we need to determine the limiting reactant. Since both solutions have the same concentration (0.2 M) and volume (50 mL), they will react in a 1:1 ratio, and neither is in excess.

Now, we need to find the moles of the limiting reactant:

moles = Molarity × Volume
moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.050 L = 0.010 mol (for both AgNO₃ and NaCl)

The enthalpy of precipitation (ΔH) can be found using the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) values for each compound in the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation values at 25°C are as follows:

ΔHf(AgNO₃) = -124.4 kJ/mol
ΔHf(NaCl) = -411.12 kJ/mol
ΔHf(AgCl) = -127.01 kJ/mol
ΔHf(NaNO₃) = -365.6 kJ/mol

We can use these values to calculate the enthalpy of precipitation using Hess's Law:

ΔH = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)

ΔH = [(1 mol × -127.01 kJ/mol) + (1 mol × -365.6 kJ/mol)] - [(1 mol × -124.4 kJ/mol) + (1 mol × -411.12 kJ/mol)]

ΔH = (-127.01 - 365.6) - (-124.4 - 411.12)
ΔH = -492.61 + 535.52
ΔH = 42.91 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction between 50 mL of 0.2 M AgNO₃ and 50 mL of 0.2 M NaCl is 42.91 kJ/mol.
