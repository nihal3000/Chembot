Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of polymerization for the synthesis of polyethylene from its monomer using the given data:
- Standard enthalpy of formation of ethylene (C2H4) = +52.3 kJ/mol
- Standard enthalpy of formation of polyethylene (-[-CH2-]n-) = -256 kJ/mol
To calculate the enthalpy of polymerization for the synthesis of polyethylene from its monomer, we need to find the difference in enthalpy between the reactants and the products.

The reaction can be represented as:

n C2H4 → [-CH2-]n

where n is the number of moles of ethylene monomer.

The enthalpy of polymerization (ΔH_polymerization) can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_polymerization = ΔH_products - ΔH_reactants

The standard enthalpy of formation of ethylene (C2H4) is given as +52.3 kJ/mol, and the standard enthalpy of formation of polyethylene (-[-CH2-]n-) is given as -256 kJ/mol.

Since there are n moles of ethylene in the reaction, the total enthalpy of the reactants is:

ΔH_reactants = n * (+52.3 kJ/mol)

The enthalpy of the product (polyethylene) is:

ΔH_products = -256 kJ/mol

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy of polymerization:

ΔH_polymerization = (-256 kJ/mol) - n * (+52.3 kJ/mol)

However, we need to find the enthalpy of polymerization per mole of ethylene. To do this, we can divide the equation by n:

ΔH_polymerization/n = (-256 kJ/mol) / n - (+52.3 kJ/mol)

Since the enthalpy of polymerization is for the synthesis of polyethylene from one mole of ethylene, n = 1:

ΔH_polymerization = -256 kJ/mol - 52.3 kJ/mol

ΔH_polymerization = -308.3 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy of polymerization for the synthesis of polyethylene from its monomer is -308.3 kJ/mol.
