Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of adsorption for the adsorption of hydrogen gas onto a nickel surface at 25°C, given that the equilibrium pressure of hydrogen gas is 0.5 atm and the surface coverage is 0.2 monolayers. The heat of dissociation of hydrogen gas is 436 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy of adsorption, we can use the Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation and the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation is:

θ = (KP) / (1 + KP)

where θ is the surface coverage (0.2 monolayers), K is the Langmuir constant, and P is the equilibrium pressure of hydrogen gas (0.5 atm).

First, we need to find the Langmuir constant (K) using the given surface coverage and equilibrium pressure:

0.2 = (K * 0.5) / (1 + K * 0.5)

Solving for K, we get:

K = 0.4 / (1 - 0.4) = 0.4 / 0.6 = 2/3

Now, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to relate the enthalpy of adsorption (ΔH_ads) to the Langmuir constant:

ln(K) = -ΔH_ads / (RT) + C

where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K), and C is a constant. We can ignore the constant C since we are only interested in the enthalpy of adsorption.

ln(2/3) = -ΔH_ads / (8.314 * 298)

Now, we can solve for ΔH_ads:

ΔH_ads = -8.314 * 298 * ln(2/3) = 1715.5 J/mol

However, this is the enthalpy of adsorption for the dissociative adsorption process, which involves breaking the H-H bond. We need to account for the heat of dissociation of hydrogen gas (436 kJ/mol) to find the enthalpy of adsorption for the overall process:

ΔH_ads_total = ΔH_ads + ΔH_dissociation
ΔH_ads_total = 1715.5 J/mol + 436,000 J/mol = 437,715.5 J/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy of adsorption for the adsorption of hydrogen gas onto a nickel surface at 25°C is approximately 437.7 kJ/mol.
