Enthalpy of ionization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of ionization of magnesium using the following data: the first ionization energy of Mg is 738 kJ/mol and the lattice energy of MgCl₂ is -2495 kJ/mol.
The enthalpy of ionization of magnesium refers to the energy required to remove one electron from a magnesium atom to form a magnesium ion (Mg²⁺). In this case, we are given the first ionization energy of Mg, which is the energy required to remove one electron from a magnesium atom to form a Mg⁺ ion. However, we need to find the energy required to remove a second electron to form a Mg²⁺ ion.

Unfortunately, the given data (lattice energy of MgCl₂) is not directly related to the ionization energy of magnesium. The lattice energy of MgCl₂ is the energy released when one mole of solid MgCl₂ is formed from its gaseous ions (Mg²⁺ and 2Cl⁻). 

To find the enthalpy of ionization of magnesium (Mg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻), we need the second ionization energy of Mg. The first ionization energy is given as 738 kJ/mol, and the second ionization energy of Mg is approximately 1450 kJ/mol.

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy of ionization of magnesium:

Enthalpy of ionization = First ionization energy + Second ionization energy
Enthalpy of ionization = 738 kJ/mol + 1450 kJ/mol
Enthalpy of ionization = 2188 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy of ionization of magnesium is 2188 kJ/mol.
