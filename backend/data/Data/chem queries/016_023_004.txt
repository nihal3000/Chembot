Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
What is the enthalpy change of hydrolysis for sodium acetate if 50 g of solid sodium acetate is dissolved in 500 mL of water at 25°C, and the resulting solution is then diluted to a final volume of 1 L? The enthalpy of solution for sodium acetate is -16.9 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change of hydrolysis for sodium acetate, we first need to determine the number of moles of sodium acetate dissolved in the solution. Sodium acetate has a molar mass of 82.03 g/mol (Na: 22.99 g/mol, C: 12.01 g/mol, O: 16.00 g/mol x 2, H: 1.01 g/mol x 3).

1. Calculate the moles of sodium acetate:
moles = mass / molar mass
moles = 50 g / 82.03 g/mol
moles ≈ 0.609 mol

2. Calculate the enthalpy change of hydrolysis:
enthalpy change = moles × enthalpy of solution
enthalpy change = 0.609 mol × -16.9 kJ/mol
enthalpy change ≈ -10.3 kJ

The enthalpy change of hydrolysis for sodium acetate when 50 g of solid sodium acetate is dissolved in 500 mL of water at 25°C and then diluted to a final volume of 1 L is approximately -10.3 kJ.
