Enthalpy of desorption calculations
Here's a precise problem for a chemistry student to solve, based on Thermochemistry and the Enthalpy of Desorption Calculations:

Given the following data for the adsorption of hydrogen gas on a metal surface:
- Initial pressure of hydrogen gas = 1 atm
- Final pressure of hydrogen gas after adsorption = 0.2 atm
- Temperature = 298 K
- Surface area of the metal = 5 cm^2
- Enthalpy of Desorption of hydrogen gas on the metal surface = -40 kJ/mol

Calculate the enthalpy change (in kJ) for the adsorption of hydrogen gas on the metal surface.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the adsorption of hydrogen gas on the metal surface, we first need to determine the amount of hydrogen gas adsorbed. We can do this using the Ideal Gas Law:

PV = nRT

Where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm/mol K), and T is temperature.

First, we need to find the change in pressure (ΔP) of hydrogen gas:
ΔP = Initial pressure - Final pressure = 1 atm - 0.2 atm = 0.8 atm

Next, we need to find the volume of hydrogen gas adsorbed. Since we don't have the volume, we can assume that the volume of the gas before and after adsorption is the same. Therefore, we can use the ratio of the initial and final pressures to find the ratio of the initial and final moles of hydrogen gas:

n_initial / n_final = P_initial / P_final

n_initial / n_final = 1 atm / 0.2 atm = 5

Since the ratio of initial to final moles is 5, the change in moles (Δn) is:

Δn = n_initial - n_final = 4 * n_final

Now we can use the Ideal Gas Law to find the moles of hydrogen gas adsorbed:

PV = nRT
(0.8 atm) * V = (4 * n_final) * (0.0821 L atm/mol K) * (298 K)

We can cancel out the volume (V) since it is the same before and after adsorption:

0.8 = 4 * n_final * 0.0821 * 298

Now, we can solve for n_final:

n_final = 0.8 / (4 * 0.0821 * 298) = 0.00268 mol

Since Δn = 4 * n_final, we can find the moles of hydrogen gas adsorbed:

Δn = 4 * 0.00268 mol = 0.01072 mol

Finally, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the adsorption of hydrogen gas on the metal surface using the Enthalpy of Desorption:

ΔH_adsorption = -ΔH_desorption * Δn
ΔH_adsorption = -(-40 kJ/mol) * 0.01072 mol = 0.4288 kJ

The enthalpy change for the adsorption of hydrogen gas on the metal surface is approximately 0.429 kJ.
