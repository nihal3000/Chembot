Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of polymerization for the formation of polystyrene from its monomer, styrene, given the following data:

- ΔH°f (Styrene) = -25.68 kJ/mol
- Bond enthalpies: C-C = 347 kJ/mol; C=C = 611 kJ/mol; C-H = 413 kJ/mol
To calculate the enthalpy change of polymerization for the formation of polystyrene from its monomer, styrene, we need to consider the bonds broken and bonds formed during the process. 

In the polymerization process, the double bond (C=C) in styrene is broken and a single bond (C-C) is formed between the styrene monomers. 

1. Bonds broken: One C=C bond in each styrene monomer
2. Bonds formed: One C-C bond between each styrene monomer

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the polymerization process using the given bond enthalpies:

ΔH_polymerization = (Bonds formed - Bonds broken)

ΔH_polymerization = [(1 × C-C) - (1 × C=C)]

Using the given bond enthalpies:

ΔH_polymerization = [(1 × 347 kJ/mol) - (1 × 611 kJ/mol)]

ΔH_polymerization = -264 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy change of polymerization for the formation of polystyrene from its monomer, styrene, is -264 kJ/mol.
