Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction that occurs when 50.0 mL of 0.100 M AgNO3 (aq) and 25.0 mL of 0.100 M NaCl (aq) are mixed together. The final temperature of the solution is 25.0°C, and the initial temperature of both solutions was 25.0°C. The heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/(g °C) and the density of each solution is 1.00 g/mL. Assume that the reaction goes to completion and that the density and specific heat capacity of the resulting solution are the same as those of pure water.
First, we need to determine the limiting reactant in the precipitation reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:

AgNO3 (aq) + NaCl (aq) → AgCl (s) + NaNO3 (aq)

Now, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:

Moles of AgNO3 = (0.100 mol/L) * (50.0 mL) * (1 L/1000 mL) = 0.00500 mol
Moles of NaCl = (0.100 mol/L) * (25.0 mL) * (1 L/1000 mL) = 0.00250 mol

Since there are fewer moles of NaCl, it is the limiting reactant. The reaction will produce 0.00250 mol of AgCl precipitate.

Next, we can calculate the mass of the solution:

Mass of the solution = (50.0 mL + 25.0 mL) * (1.00 g/mL) = 75.0 g

Since the initial and final temperatures of the solution are the same (25.0°C), there is no temperature change, and thus no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. Therefore, the enthalpy change for the reaction is 0 J.
