Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
What is the enthalpy change of adsorption when 10 grams of activated charcoal absorb 1 mole of methane gas at a temperature of 298 K? Given that the van't Hoff factor for the adsorption of methane on activated charcoal is 10.5 kJ/mol.
The enthalpy change of adsorption (ΔH_ads) can be calculated using the van't Hoff factor (ΔH_van't Hoff) given for the adsorption of methane on activated charcoal. In this case, the van't Hoff factor is 10.5 kJ/mol.

Since 1 mole of methane gas is being adsorbed by the activated charcoal, the enthalpy change of adsorption can be directly obtained from the van't Hoff factor:

ΔH_ads = ΔH_van't Hoff
ΔH_ads = 10.5 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy change of adsorption when 10 grams of activated charcoal absorb 1 mole of methane gas at 298 K is 10.5 kJ/mol.
