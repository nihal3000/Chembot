Enthalpy of ionization calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the ionization of sodium chloride if 5.00 g of NaCl is dissolved in 100.0 g of water, and the temperature of the solution increases from 25.0°C to 27.5°C? The specific heat of the solution is 4.18 J/g °C and the density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the ionization of sodium chloride, we can use the formula:

q = mcΔT

where q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat of the solution, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

First, let's find the mass of the solution. Since the density of the solution is 1.00 g/mL, the mass of the solution is:

mass of solution = mass of water + mass of NaCl
mass of solution = 100.0 g + 5.00 g = 105.0 g

Next, we can find the change in temperature:

ΔT = T_final - T_initial
ΔT = 27.5°C - 25.0°C = 2.5°C

Now, we can calculate the heat absorbed or released (q) using the formula:

q = mcΔT
q = (105.0 g)(4.18 J/g °C)(2.5°C)
q = 1098.95 J

Since the temperature of the solution increased, the enthalpy change is negative (exothermic reaction). Therefore, the enthalpy change for the ionization of sodium chloride is -1098.95 J.
