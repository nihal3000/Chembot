Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
What is the enthalpy change of isomerization for the following reaction?

CH3CH=CHCH3 (1-butene) ⇌ CH3CH2CH=CH2 (2-butene)

Given that the enthalpy of formation for 1-butene is -44.23 kJ/mol and for 2-butene is -44.72 kJ/mol. The heat of combustion for 1-butene is -2654 kJ/mol and for 2-butene is -2654.4 kJ/mol.
To find the enthalpy change of isomerization for the given reaction, we can use the difference in enthalpy of formation between the two isomers:

ΔH_isomerization = ΔH_f(2-butene) - ΔH_f(1-butene)

ΔH_isomerization = (-44.72 kJ/mol) - (-44.23 kJ/mol)

ΔH_isomerization = -0.49 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change of isomerization for the given reaction is -0.49 kJ/mol.
