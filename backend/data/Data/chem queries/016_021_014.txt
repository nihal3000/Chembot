Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the polymerization of polyethylene using the following information: 

ΔHf° of ethylene (-20.4 kJ/mol) and polyethylene (-1024 kJ/mol); the reaction equation: 

nC2H4 (g) → [-CH2-CH2-]n (s)
To calculate the enthalpy change for the polymerization of polyethylene, we need to find the difference in enthalpy between the reactants and products. In this case, the reactants are ethylene (C2H4) and the product is polyethylene ([-CH2-CH2-]n).

The given enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) values are:
ΔHf° of ethylene (C2H4) = -20.4 kJ/mol
ΔHf° of polyethylene ([-CH2-CH2-]n) = -1024 kJ/mol

Since the reaction equation is:
nC2H4 (g) → [-CH2-CH2-]n (s)

We can write the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction as:
ΔH = ΔHf° (products) - ΔHf° (reactants)

However, we need to account for the "n" moles of ethylene in the reaction. So, the equation becomes:
ΔH = ΔHf° (polyethylene) - n * ΔHf° (ethylene)

Now, we can plug in the given values:
ΔH = (-1024 kJ/mol) - n * (-20.4 kJ/mol)

Since we are looking for the enthalpy change per mole of ethylene, we can divide both sides of the equation by "n":
ΔH/n = (-1024 kJ/mol) / n - (-20.4 kJ/mol)

Now, we can simplify the equation:
ΔH/n = -1024 kJ/mol + 20.4 kJ/mol

ΔH/n = -1003.6 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy change for the polymerization of polyethylene is -1003.6 kJ/mol of ethylene.
