Enthalpy of ionization calculations
What is the enthalpy change of ionization for magnesium (Mg) given that it requires 738 kJ/mol to remove the first electron and 1450 kJ/mol to remove the second electron from a Mg atom?
The enthalpy change of ionization for magnesium (Mg) can be calculated by adding the energy required to remove the first electron and the energy required to remove the second electron.

Enthalpy change of ionization = Energy to remove first electron + Energy to remove second electron

Enthalpy change of ionization = 738 kJ/mol + 1450 kJ/mol

Enthalpy change of ionization = 2188 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change of ionization for magnesium is 2188 kJ/mol.
