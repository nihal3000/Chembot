Enthalpy of desorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change when solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is dissolved into water, given that the desorption enthalpy of NaOH is 44.51 kJ/mol and the molar heat of solution is -44.51 kJ/mol.
The enthalpy change when solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is dissolved into water can be calculated using the following equation:

ΔH_solution = ΔH_desorption + ΔH_hydration

Where ΔH_solution is the molar heat of solution, ΔH_desorption is the desorption enthalpy of NaOH, and ΔH_hydration is the enthalpy change associated with the hydration of the ions.

Given that the molar heat of solution (ΔH_solution) is -44.51 kJ/mol and the desorption enthalpy (ΔH_desorption) is 44.51 kJ/mol, we can rearrange the equation to solve for ΔH_hydration:

ΔH_hydration = ΔH_solution - ΔH_desorption

ΔH_hydration = -44.51 kJ/mol - 44.51 kJ/mol

ΔH_hydration = -89.02 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy change when solid sodium hydroxide is dissolved into water is -89.02 kJ/mol.
