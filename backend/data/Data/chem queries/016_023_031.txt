Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 5 moles of methyl acetate using the given bond enthalpies: C-O (360 kJ/mol), C=O (740 kJ/mol), O-H (460 kJ/mol), and C-H (410 kJ/mol).
To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of methyl acetate, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:

Methyl acetate (CH3COOCH3) + Water (H2O) → Acetic acid (CH3COOH) + Methanol (CH3OH)

Now, we need to determine the bond enthalpies for the reactants and products.

Reactants:
1 C-O bond in methyl acetate: 1 x 360 kJ/mol = 360 kJ/mol
1 C=O bond in methyl acetate: 1 x 740 kJ/mol = 740 kJ/mol
3 C-H bonds in methyl acetate: 3 x 410 kJ/mol = 1230 kJ/mol
2 O-H bonds in water: 2 x 460 kJ/mol = 920 kJ/mol

Total bond enthalpy for reactants: 360 + 740 + 1230 + 920 = 3250 kJ/mol

Products:
1 C-O bond in acetic acid: 1 x 360 kJ/mol = 360 kJ/mol
1 C=O bond in acetic acid: 1 x 740 kJ/mol = 740 kJ/mol
3 C-H bonds in acetic acid: 3 x 410 kJ/mol = 1230 kJ/mol
1 O-H bond in acetic acid: 1 x 460 kJ/mol = 460 kJ/mol
1 O-H bond in methanol: 1 x 460 kJ/mol = 460 kJ/mol
3 C-H bonds in methanol: 3 x 410 kJ/mol = 1230 kJ/mol

Total bond enthalpy for products: 360 + 740 + 1230 + 460 + 460 + 1230 = 3780 kJ/mol

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:

ΔH = Bond enthalpy of products - Bond enthalpy of reactants
ΔH = 3780 kJ/mol - 3250 kJ/mol
ΔH = 530 kJ/mol

Since we are calculating the enthalpy change for 5 moles of methyl acetate, we need to multiply the enthalpy change per mole by 5:

ΔH for 5 moles = 530 kJ/mol x 5 moles = 2650 kJ

The enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 5 moles of methyl acetate is 2650 kJ.
