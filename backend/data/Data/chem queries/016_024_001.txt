Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction of barium chloride and sodium sulfate, given that the initial concentrations of the two solutions are 0.2 M and are mixed in a coffee cup calorimeter. The final temperature observed is 25°C and the heat capacity of the coffee cup is 10 J/°C.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between barium chloride (BaCl2) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4).

BaCl2 (aq) + Na2SO4 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2NaCl (aq)

Next, we need to determine the amount of heat (q) released or absorbed during the reaction. Since we are given the heat capacity of the coffee cup calorimeter (10 J/°C) and the final temperature (25°C), we can calculate the heat released or absorbed using the formula:

q = C × ΔT

where q is the heat released or absorbed, C is the heat capacity of the calorimeter, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

However, we are not given the initial temperature of the solutions. We will assume that the initial temperature of both solutions is also 25°C, which means there is no temperature change during the reaction. In this case, ΔT = 0, and the heat released or absorbed (q) is also 0.

q = 10 J/°C × 0°C = 0 J

Since there is no heat released or absorbed during the reaction, the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the precipitation reaction is also 0.

ΔH = 0 J

Therefore, the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction of barium chloride and sodium sulfate is 0 J.
