Enthalpy of desorption calculations
Determine the enthalpy of desorption for carbon dioxide from activated charcoal at 25°C. Given: the equilibrium pressure of CO2 is 0.1 atm and the mass of charcoal used is 2.5 g.
To determine the enthalpy of desorption for carbon dioxide from activated charcoal, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and enthalpy of desorption (ΔH_des):

ln(P2/P1) = -ΔH_des/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Here, P1 and P2 are the equilibrium pressures of CO2 at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).

Given the equilibrium pressure of CO2 (P2) at 25°C (298.15 K) is 0.1 atm, we need to find the reference pressure (P1) at a known reference temperature (T1). Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the problem statement. 

To proceed, we would need either the reference pressure and temperature or the enthalpy of desorption directly. If you can provide this information, we can continue with the calculation.
