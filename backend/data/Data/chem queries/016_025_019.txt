Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
Sure, here's a question for a chemistry student to solve:

What is the enthalpy change in kJ/mol when 5.00 g of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissolves in 100.00 mL of water at 25°C? The molar mass of NaOH is 40.00 g/mol and the density of water is 1.00 g/mL. Assume the specific heat capacity of the solution is equal to that of water, and that the solution is formed with no change in volume. The enthalpy of dissolving NaOH in water is -44.5 kJ/mol.
To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaOH that are being dissolved. We can do this using the given mass of NaOH and its molar mass:

moles of NaOH = (mass of NaOH) / (molar mass of NaOH)
moles of NaOH = (5.00 g) / (40.00 g/mol)
moles of NaOH = 0.125 mol

Now that we know the number of moles of NaOH, we can calculate the enthalpy change for this specific amount of NaOH using the given enthalpy of dissolving NaOH in water:

enthalpy change = (moles of NaOH) * (enthalpy of dissolving NaOH)
enthalpy change = (0.125 mol) * (-44.5 kJ/mol)
enthalpy change = -5.56 kJ

So, the enthalpy change when 5.00 g of sodium hydroxide dissolves in 100.00 mL of water at 25°C is -5.56 kJ.
