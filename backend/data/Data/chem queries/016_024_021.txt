Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
Given the enthalpy of solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is -44.5 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is -74.8 kJ/mol, calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between NaOH and HCl, assuming all solutions are at a concentration of 1 M.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between NaOH and HCl, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:

NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)

Now, we can use Hess's Law to determine the enthalpy change for this reaction. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we can break the reaction into two steps:

1. Dissolving NaOH and HCl in water:
NaOH(s) → NaOH(aq)    ΔH1 = -44.5 kJ/mol
HCl(g) → HCl(aq)      ΔH2 = -74.8 kJ/mol

2. Precipitation reaction between NaOH(aq) and HCl(aq):
NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)    ΔH3 = ?

We can now use Hess's Law to find ΔH3:

ΔH3 = ΔH1 + ΔH2

ΔH3 = -44.5 kJ/mol + (-74.8 kJ/mol)

ΔH3 = -119.3 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between NaOH and HCl is -119.3 kJ/mol.
