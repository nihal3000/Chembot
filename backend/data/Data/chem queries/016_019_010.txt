Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
Determine the enthalpy of adsorption for the reaction of hydrogen gas adsorbing onto a platinum surface, given that 2.00 g of hydrogen gas is adsorbed onto a 1.00 g platinum surface at 25°C and the pressure is 1 bar. The volume of the system is 1.00 L and the initial temperature of the platinum surface is also 25°C. Assume that the surface is in thermal equilibrium with the surroundings and that the gas behaves ideally.
To determine the enthalpy of adsorption for the reaction of hydrogen gas adsorbing onto a platinum surface, we can use the following equation:

ΔH_ads = ΔU_ads + PΔV

where ΔH_ads is the enthalpy of adsorption, ΔU_ads is the internal energy change, P is the pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.

First, we need to find the moles of hydrogen gas adsorbed. The molar mass of hydrogen gas (H2) is 2.016 g/mol.

moles of H2 = (2.00 g) / (2.016 g/mol) = 0.9921 mol

Next, we need to find the initial and final volumes of the hydrogen gas. Since the initial volume is given as 1.00 L, we can use the ideal gas law to find the initial moles of hydrogen gas:

PV = nRT

where P is the pressure (1 bar = 100,000 Pa), V is the volume (1.00 L = 0.001 m³), n is the moles of hydrogen gas, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)), and T is the temperature (25°C = 298.15 K).

(100,000 Pa)(0.001 m³) = n(8.314 J/(mol·K))(298.15 K)

n = 0.0404 mol

The final moles of hydrogen gas are the initial moles plus the moles adsorbed:

n_final = 0.0404 mol + 0.9921 mol = 1.0325 mol

Now we can find the final volume using the ideal gas law:

V_final = nRT/P

V_final = (1.0325 mol)(8.314 J/(mol·K))(298.15 K) / (100,000 Pa)

V_final = 0.001025 m³ = 1.025 L

The change in volume is:

ΔV = V_final - V_initial = 1.025 L - 1.00 L = 0.025 L = 0.000025 m³

Now we need to find the internal energy change (ΔU_ads). Since the platinum surface is in thermal equilibrium with the surroundings, there is no temperature change, and the internal energy change is zero:

ΔU_ads = 0

Finally, we can find the enthalpy of adsorption:

ΔH_ads = ΔU_ads + PΔV

ΔH_ads = 0 + (100,000 Pa)(0.000025 m³)

ΔH_ads = 2.5 J

The enthalpy of adsorption for the reaction of hydrogen gas adsorbing onto a platinum surface is 2.5 J.
