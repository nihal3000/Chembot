Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of the isomerization of but-2-ene to 2-methylpropene given the standard enthalpy of formation of but-2-ene is -20.4 kJ/mol and that of 2-methylpropene is -27.0 kJ/mol. The reaction is carried out at constant pressure and 298 K.
To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) of the isomerization reaction, we can use the following formula:

ΔH = Σ(ΔHf products) - Σ(ΔHf reactants)

In this case, the reaction is:

but-2-ene → 2-methylpropene

The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of but-2-ene is -20.4 kJ/mol, and that of 2-methylpropene is -27.0 kJ/mol.

Using the formula, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:

ΔH = (-27.0 kJ/mol) - (-20.4 kJ/mol)

ΔH = -27.0 + 20.4
ΔH = -6.6 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the isomerization of but-2-ene to 2-methylpropene is -6.6 kJ/mol.
