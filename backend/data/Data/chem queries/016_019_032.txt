Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of adsorption when 2.5 grams of hydrogen gas is adsorbed onto a surface at a temperature of 298 K. The equilibrium pressure of hydrogen gas at this temperature is 1.5 atm and the surface area of the adsorbent is 50 cm². (Assume ideal gas behavior and that the adsorption occurs under standard conditions.)
To calculate the enthalpy of adsorption, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ΔH_ads = -RT * ln(P/P₀)

where ΔH_ads is the enthalpy of adsorption, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K), P is the equilibrium pressure (1.5 atm), and P₀ is the standard pressure (1 atm).

First, we need to convert the pressure from atm to Pa:

1 atm = 101325 Pa

P = 1.5 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 151987.5 Pa
P₀ = 1 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 101325 Pa

Now, we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ΔH_ads = -8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K * ln(151987.5 Pa / 101325 Pa)
ΔH_ads = -8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K * ln(1.5)
ΔH_ads ≈ -3486.9 J/mol

Now, we need to find the number of moles of hydrogen gas:

Molar mass of H₂ = 2 g/mol
Number of moles = mass / molar mass = 2.5 g / 2 g/mol = 1.25 mol

Finally, we can calculate the total enthalpy of adsorption:

Total enthalpy of adsorption = ΔH_ads * number of moles
Total enthalpy of adsorption = -3486.9 J/mol * 1.25 mol
Total enthalpy of adsorption ≈ -4358.6 J

So, the enthalpy of adsorption for 2.5 grams of hydrogen gas adsorbed onto the surface is approximately -4358.6 J.
