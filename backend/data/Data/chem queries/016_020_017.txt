Enthalpy of desorption calculations
Calculate the amount of energy required to completely desorb 2 moles of hydrogen molecules from a metal surface if the enthalpy of desorption for each H2 molecule is 436 kJ/mol.
To calculate the amount of energy required to completely desorb 2 moles of hydrogen molecules from a metal surface, we can use the following equation:

Energy = moles × enthalpy of desorption

Given that there are 2 moles of hydrogen molecules and the enthalpy of desorption for each H2 molecule is 436 kJ/mol, we can plug these values into the equation:

Energy = 2 moles × 436 kJ/mol

Energy = 872 kJ

Therefore, 872 kJ of energy is required to completely desorb 2 moles of hydrogen molecules from a metal surface.
