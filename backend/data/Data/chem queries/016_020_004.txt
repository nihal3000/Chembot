Enthalpy of desorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of desorption of CO2 from sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pellets given the following information: 

- The heat of absorption of CO2 by NaOH pellets is -20.9 kJ/mol.
- The standard enthalpy of formation of Na2CO3 is -1130 kJ/mol.
- The standard enthalpy of formation of water is -286 kJ/mol.
- The standard enthalpy of formation of NaOH is -425 kJ/mol. 

Assuming that the desorption process is the reverse of the absorption process, determine the enthalpy change for the reaction: Na2CO3(s) + H2O(l) → 2NaOH(s) + CO2(g).
To determine the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:

ΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)

For the given reaction: Na2CO3(s) + H2O(l) → 2NaOH(s) + CO2(g)

ΔH_f(Na2CO3) = -1130 kJ/mol
ΔH_f(H2O) = -286 kJ/mol
ΔH_f(NaOH) = -425 kJ/mol

The enthalpy of formation for CO2 is not given, but we can calculate it using the heat of absorption of CO2 by NaOH pellets:

ΔH_absorption = -20.9 kJ/mol

Since the desorption process is the reverse of the absorption process, the enthalpy of desorption of CO2 is the opposite of the heat of absorption:

ΔH_desorption(CO2) = 20.9 kJ/mol

Now we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:

ΔH_reaction = [2 × ΔH_f(NaOH) + ΔH_desorption(CO2)] - [ΔH_f(Na2CO3) + ΔH_f(H2O)]

ΔH_reaction = [2 × (-425 kJ/mol) + 20.9 kJ/mol] - [-1130 kJ/mol - 286 kJ/mol]

ΔH_reaction = [-850 kJ/mol + 20.9 kJ/mol] - [-1416 kJ/mol]

ΔH_reaction = -829.1 kJ/mol + 1416 kJ/mol

ΔH_reaction = 586.9 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the reaction Na2CO3(s) + H2O(l) → 2NaOH(s) + CO2(g) is 586.9 kJ/mol.
