Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2, given that the standard enthalpy of formation for butene-1 and butene-2 are -123 kJ/mol and -131 kJ/mol respectively?
To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2, we can use the following equation:

ΔH = ΔHf(products) - ΔHf(reactants)

In this case, the reactant is butene-1 and the product is butene-2. The standard enthalpy of formation for butene-1 is -123 kJ/mol and for butene-2 is -131 kJ/mol.

ΔH = (-131 kJ/mol) - (-123 kJ/mol)

ΔH = -8 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2 is -8 kJ/mol.
