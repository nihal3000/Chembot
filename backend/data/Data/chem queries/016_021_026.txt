Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of polymerization for the formation of polyethylene from its monomer, ethylene, given the following information:

- The enthalpy of formation for ethylene is -84.7 kJ/mol.
- The enthalpy of combustion for ethylene is -1410.1 kJ/mol.
- The enthalpy of combustion for polyethylene is -5115.0 kJ/mol.
- The molar mass of ethylene is 28.05 g/mol, and the molar mass of polyethylene is 28,000 g/mol (assume the polymer has an average degree of polymerization of 1000).
To calculate the enthalpy of polymerization, we will use the following equation:

ΔH_polymerization = ΔH_combustion_polyethylene - n * ΔH_combustion_ethylene + n * ΔH_formation_ethylene

where n is the number of ethylene molecules involved in the formation of one polyethylene molecule.

Since the average degree of polymerization is 1000, it means that 1000 ethylene molecules are involved in the formation of one polyethylene molecule. Therefore, n = 1000.

Now, we can plug in the given values:

ΔH_polymerization = (-5115.0 kJ/mol) - 1000 * (-1410.1 kJ/mol) + 1000 * (-84.7 kJ/mol)

ΔH_polymerization = -5115.0 kJ/mol + 1410100 kJ/mol - 84700 kJ/mol

ΔH_polymerization = 1324285 kJ/mol

However, this value is for the formation of one polyethylene molecule with a molar mass of 28,000 g/mol. To find the enthalpy of polymerization per mole of ethylene, we need to divide this value by the number of ethylene molecules involved (1000):

ΔH_polymerization_per_mole_ethylene = 1324285 kJ/mol / 1000

ΔH_polymerization_per_mole_ethylene = 1324.285 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy of polymerization for the formation of polyethylene from its monomer, ethylene, is approximately 1324.3 kJ/mol.
