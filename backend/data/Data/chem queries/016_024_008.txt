Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the precipitation of 50.0 g of barium sulfate in water, given that the reactants are initially at 25.0 °C and the final temperature of the solution after the reaction is 35.0 °C? The molar heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g·°C and the enthalpy of solution for barium sulfate in water is -176.3 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation of barium sulfate, we first need to determine the number of moles of barium sulfate involved in the reaction. The molar mass of barium sulfate (BaSO4) is 137.3 g/mol (Ba) + 32.1 g/mol (S) + 4 * 16.0 g/mol (O) = 233.4 g/mol.

Number of moles of BaSO4 = (50.0 g) / (233.4 g/mol) = 0.214 mol

Now we need to calculate the heat absorbed by the solution due to the temperature change. The mass of the solution can be assumed to be approximately equal to the mass of water, which is 50.0 g (since the mass of barium sulfate is negligible compared to the mass of water).

Heat absorbed by the solution (q) = mass of solution × molar heat capacity × change in temperature
q = 50.0 g × 4.18 J/g·°C × (35.0 °C - 25.0 °C)
q = 50.0 g × 4.18 J/g·°C × 10.0 °C
q = 2090 J

Since the heat absorbed by the solution is equal to the heat released by the reaction, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation of barium sulfate.

Enthalpy change (ΔH) = -q / number of moles
ΔH = -2090 J / 0.214 mol
ΔH = -9763.08 J/mol

However, this value is the enthalpy change for the temperature change only. We also need to consider the enthalpy of solution for barium sulfate, which is -176.3 kJ/mol.

Total enthalpy change (ΔH_total) = ΔH + enthalpy of solution
ΔH_total = -9763.08 J/mol + (-176.3 kJ/mol × 1000 J/1 kJ)
ΔH_total = -9763.08 J/mol - 176300 J/mol
ΔH_total = -186063.08 J/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy change for the precipitation of 50.0 g of barium sulfate in water is approximately -186.1 kJ/mol.
