The effect of temperature on the photochemical reaction rate
What is the effect of temperature on the rate of photochemical reactions that involve the isomerization of a molecule from the cis- to trans- configuration?
The effect of temperature on the rate of photochemical reactions involving the isomerization of a molecule from the cis- to trans- configuration can be complex and depends on the specific reaction and conditions. However, there are some general trends that can be observed.

1. Activation energy: Photochemical reactions often have lower activation energies than thermal reactions, which means that they can occur at lower temperatures. As the temperature increases, the rate of the reaction may increase due to the increased availability of energy to overcome the activation energy barrier.

2. Thermal equilibrium: At higher temperatures, the equilibrium between the cis- and trans- isomers may shift towards the more thermodynamically stable trans- configuration. This can lead to an increase in the rate of the photochemical reaction as more cis- isomers are available to undergo isomerization.

3. Reaction kinetics: The rate of a photochemical reaction depends on the absorption of light by the reactants and the subsequent formation and decay of excited states. As the temperature increases, the rate of decay of the excited states may increase, which can lead to a decrease in the overall rate of the photochemical reaction.

4. Solvent effects: The solvent can play a significant role in the rate of photochemical reactions. As the temperature increases, the solvent viscosity may decrease, which can lead to an increase in the rate of the reaction due to enhanced diffusion and molecular collisions.

5. Competing reactions: At higher temperatures, competing thermal reactions may become more significant, which can lead to a decrease in the rate of the photochemical reaction as the reactants are consumed by other processes.

In summary, the effect of temperature on the rate of photochemical reactions involving the isomerization of a molecule from the cis- to trans- configuration can be influenced by various factors, including activation energy, thermal equilibrium, reaction kinetics, solvent effects, and competing reactions. The specific effect of temperature on the rate of a given reaction will depend on the interplay of these factors and the details of the reaction system.
