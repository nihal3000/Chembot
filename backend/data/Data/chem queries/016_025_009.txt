Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 g of NaOH in 100 mL of water at 25°C. The molar heat of dissolution of NaOH is -44.51 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 g of NaOH in 100 mL of water, we need to determine the number of moles of NaOH and then use the molar heat of dissolution to find the enthalpy change.

First, let's find the number of moles of NaOH:

The molar mass of NaOH = 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 15.999 g/mol (O) + 1.007 g/mol (H) = 39.996 g/mol

Now, we can find the number of moles:

moles of NaOH = mass / molar mass
moles of NaOH = 10 g / 39.996 g/mol = 0.2501 mol

Now, we can use the molar heat of dissolution to find the enthalpy change:

ΔH = moles × molar heat of dissolution
ΔH = 0.2501 mol × (-44.51 kJ/mol) = -11.13 kJ

The enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 g of NaOH in 100 mL of water at 25°C is -11.13 kJ.
