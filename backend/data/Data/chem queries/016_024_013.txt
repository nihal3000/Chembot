Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
What is the enthalpy change of precipitation when 50 mL of 0.1 M lead nitrate solution reacts with 50 mL of 0.1 M sodium sulfate solution? The solutions are initially at 25°C and the temperature increases to 30°C after precipitation. Assume that the densities and specific heat capacities of the solutions are equal to those of water, and the heat capacity of the calorimeter is negligible.
To calculate the enthalpy change of precipitation, we can use the formula:

q = mcΔT

where q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

First, we need to determine the mass of the solution. Since the densities and specific heat capacities of the solutions are equal to those of water, we can assume that 1 mL of solution has a mass of 1 gram. Therefore, the mass of the 100 mL solution (50 mL of lead nitrate + 50 mL of sodium sulfate) is 100 grams.

Next, we need to find the specific heat capacity of the solution. Since it is equal to that of water, we can use the specific heat capacity of water, which is 4.18 J/(g·°C).

Now, we can calculate the change in temperature (ΔT). The final temperature is 30°C, and the initial temperature is 25°C, so ΔT = 30°C - 25°C = 5°C.

Using the formula q = mcΔT, we can now calculate the enthalpy change of precipitation:

q = (100 g)(4.18 J/(g·°C))(5°C) = 2090 J

The enthalpy change of precipitation is 2090 J.
