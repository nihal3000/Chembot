Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
What is the enthalpy of polymerization of polystyrene if 10 grams of styrene monomer undergo complete polymerization in a constant pressure calorimeter and releases 1195 kJ of energy as heat?
To calculate the enthalpy of polymerization (ΔH) per mole of styrene monomer, we need to determine the number of moles of styrene monomer and then divide the energy released by the number of moles.

First, let's find the molar mass of styrene monomer (C8H8). The molar mass of carbon (C) is 12.01 g/mol, and the molar mass of hydrogen (H) is 1.01 g/mol.

Molar mass of styrene = (8 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.01) = 96.08 + 8.08 = 104.16 g/mol

Now, let's find the number of moles of styrene monomer in 10 grams.

Number of moles = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 104.16 g/mol ≈ 0.096 moles

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy of polymerization (ΔH) per mole of styrene monomer.

ΔH = energy released / number of moles = 1195 kJ / 0.096 moles ≈ 12447.92 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy of polymerization of polystyrene is approximately 12,448 kJ/mol.
