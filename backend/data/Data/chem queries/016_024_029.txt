Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between 50.0 mL of 0.150 M silver nitrate solution and excess sodium chloride solution if the temperature change was measured to be -5.47°C. The molar mass of AgNO3 is 169.87 g/mol, and the density of the silver nitrate solution is 1.05 g/mL. The reaction is as follows: AgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) -> AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq).
To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we first need to determine the amount of heat released or absorbed during the reaction. We can do this using the formula:

q = mcΔT

where q is the heat released or absorbed, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity of the solution, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

First, let's find the mass of the solution. We know the volume (50.0 mL) and the density (1.05 g/mL) of the silver nitrate solution:

mass = volume × density
mass = 50.0 mL × 1.05 g/mL
mass = 52.5 g

Next, we need to find the specific heat capacity of the solution. Since the solution is mostly water, we can assume the specific heat capacity is approximately equal to that of water, which is 4.18 J/(g·°C).

Now we can calculate the heat released or absorbed using the formula:

q = mcΔT
q = (52.5 g)(4.18 J/(g·°C))(-5.47°C)
q = -1201.6 J

Since the temperature change is negative, the reaction is exothermic, and heat is released. Therefore, q = -1201.6 J.

Now we need to find the moles of AgNO3 in the reaction. We can do this using the molarity and volume of the solution:

moles = molarity × volume
moles = 0.150 mol/L × 0.050 L
moles = 0.0075 mol

Finally, we can calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction by dividing the heat released or absorbed by the moles of AgNO3:

ΔH = q / moles
ΔH = -1201.6 J / 0.0075 mol
ΔH = -160213.3 J/mol

The enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between 50.0 mL of 0.150 M silver nitrate solution and excess sodium chloride solution is approximately -160.2 kJ/mol.
