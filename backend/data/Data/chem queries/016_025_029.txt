Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5 grams of solid NaOH in 100 mL of water, given that the final temperature of the solution is 25°C? The heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g°C.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5 grams of solid NaOH in 100 mL of water, we first need to determine the initial temperature of the water. Since it is not provided, we will assume that the initial temperature of the water is also 25°C. This means that there is no temperature change during the dissolution process.

Since there is no temperature change, the enthalpy change (ΔH) can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH = m × C × ΔT

where m is the mass of the solution, C is the heat capacity of the solution, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

However, since ΔT is 0 (no temperature change), the enthalpy change (ΔH) will also be 0. Therefore, the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 5 grams of solid NaOH in 100 mL of water with no temperature change is 0 J.
