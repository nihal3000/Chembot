Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
What is the standard enthalpy change of dissolution for 5.00 grams of solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 100.0 mL of water at 25°C? Given: The molar enthalpy of dissolution of NaOH is -44.51 kJ/mol and the density of water is 0.997 g/mL.
To calculate the standard enthalpy change of dissolution for 5.00 grams of solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 100.0 mL of water at 25°C, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the moles of NaOH.
2. Use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to find the enthalpy change.

Step 1: Calculate the moles of NaOH
The molar mass of NaOH = 22.99 (Na) + 15.999 (O) + 1.007 (H) = 39.996 g/mol

moles of NaOH = mass / molar mass
moles of NaOH = 5.00 g / 39.996 g/mol = 0.125 mol

Step 2: Use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to find the enthalpy change
ΔH = moles × molar enthalpy of dissolution
ΔH = 0.125 mol × (-44.51 kJ/mol)
ΔH = -5.56 kJ

The standard enthalpy change of dissolution for 5.00 grams of solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 100.0 mL of water at 25°C is -5.56 kJ.
