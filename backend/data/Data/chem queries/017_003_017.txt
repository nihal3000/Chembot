The mechanism of photochemical reactions in organic compounds
What is the mechanism of the photochemical reaction of benzene with chlorine, and how does the substitution pattern of the resulting chlorobenzene differ from that of a typical electrophilic aromatic substitution?
The photochemical reaction of benzene with chlorine is a radical substitution reaction, which is different from the typical electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) mechanism. The reaction is initiated by the absorption of light energy (usually UV light) by the chlorine molecule, which leads to the homolytic cleavage of the Cl-Cl bond and the formation of two chlorine radicals.

The mechanism of the photochemical reaction can be described in the following steps:

1. Initiation: Absorption of light energy by the chlorine molecule (Cl2) leads to the homolytic cleavage of the Cl-Cl bond, generating two chlorine radicals (Cl•).

Cl2 + hν → 2 Cl•

2. Propagation: One of the chlorine radicals reacts with a benzene molecule by abstracting a hydrogen atom from it, forming a benzene radical (C6H5•) and a molecule of HCl.

C6H6 + Cl• → C6H5• + HCl

The benzene radical is highly reactive and can react with another chlorine molecule to form chlorobenzene and another chlorine radical.

C6H5• + Cl2 → C6H5Cl + Cl•

The newly formed chlorine radical can then react with another benzene molecule, propagating the chain reaction.

3. Termination: The reaction can be terminated when two radicals react with each other, forming a stable product. For example, two chlorine radicals can recombine to form a chlorine molecule, or a benzene radical can react with a chlorine radical to form chlorobenzene.

Cl• + Cl• → Cl2
C6H5• + Cl• → C6H5Cl

In a typical electrophilic aromatic substitution, the substitution pattern is determined by the electronic properties of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups direct it to the meta position.

However, in the photochemical reaction of benzene with chlorine, the substitution pattern is not influenced by the electronic properties of the substituents. The reaction occurs randomly at any position on the benzene ring, leading to a mixture of ortho, meta, and para isomers of chlorobenzene. This is because the reaction proceeds through a radical mechanism, which is less influenced by the electronic properties of the benzene ring compared to the electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism.
