Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of precipitation when 50.0 mL of 0.200 M BaCl2(aq) is added to 30.0 mL of 0.150 M Na2SO4(aq).
To calculate the enthalpy of precipitation, we first need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and the enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between barium chloride (BaCl2) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) is:

BaCl2(aq) + Na2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq)

Next, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we can compare the moles of each reactant:

Moles of BaCl2 = (volume × concentration) = (50.0 mL × 0.200 M) = 10.0 mmol
Moles of Na2SO4 = (volume × concentration) = (30.0 mL × 0.150 M) = 4.50 mmol

Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, we can see that Na2SO4 is the limiting reactant. Therefore, the reaction will produce 4.50 mmol of BaSO4.

Now we need to find the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction. We can use the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) values for each compound in the reaction:

ΔHf (BaCl2, aq) = -858 kJ/mol
ΔHf (Na2SO4, aq) = -1381 kJ/mol
ΔHf (BaSO4, s) = -1435 kJ/mol
ΔHf (NaCl, aq) = -407 kJ/mol

Using Hess's Law, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:

ΔH = [ΔHf (BaSO4, s) + 2ΔHf (NaCl, aq)] - [ΔHf (BaCl2, aq) + ΔHf (Na2SO4, aq)]
ΔH = [(-1435 kJ/mol) + 2(-407 kJ/mol)] - [(-858 kJ/mol) + (-1381 kJ/mol)]
ΔH = (-1435 - 814) - (-858 - 1381)
ΔH = -2249 + 2239
ΔH = -10 kJ/mol

Now we can calculate the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction:

Enthalpy of precipitation = ΔH × moles of limiting reactant
Enthalpy of precipitation = (-10 kJ/mol) × (4.50 mmol)
Enthalpy of precipitation = -45 kJ

Therefore, the enthalpy of precipitation for this reaction is -45 kJ.
