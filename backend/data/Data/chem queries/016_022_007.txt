Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2 at standard conditions, given the enthalpies of formation of butene-1, butene-2, and hydrogen gas?
To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2, we can use the following equation:

ΔH = ΣΔHf(products) - ΣΔHf(reactants)

In this case, the reactant is butene-1 and the product is butene-2. Hydrogen gas is not involved in the isomerization process, so we don't need its enthalpy of formation.

Let's denote the enthalpy of formation of butene-1 as ΔHf(butene-1) and the enthalpy of formation of butene-2 as ΔHf(butene-2).

Now, we can plug the values into the equation:

ΔH = ΔHf(butene-2) - ΔHf(butene-1)

Please provide the enthalpies of formation for butene-1 and butene-2 to calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization.
