Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of calcium chloride, given that the molar heat of formation for calcium chloride is -795.8 kJ/mol and the molar heat of formation for water is -285.8 kJ/mol? The reaction equation for the hydrolysis of calcium chloride is CaCl2 + 2H2O -> Ca(OH)2 + 2HCl, and the molar mass of CaCl2 is 110.98 g/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of calcium chloride, we need to use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for each step in the reaction. In this case, we need to find the enthalpy change for the formation of the products and subtract the enthalpy change for the formation of the reactants.

The reaction equation is: CaCl2 + 2H2O -> Ca(OH)2 + 2HCl

First, we need to find the molar heat of formation for the products, Ca(OH)2 and HCl. The molar heat of formation for Ca(OH)2 is -985 kJ/mol, and the molar heat of formation for HCl is -92.3 kJ/mol.

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the formation of the products:

ΔH(products) = 1 mol Ca(OH)2 × (-985 kJ/mol) + 2 mol HCl × (-92.3 kJ/mol) = -985 kJ - 184.6 kJ = -1169.6 kJ

Next, we need to calculate the enthalpy change for the formation of the reactants:

ΔH(reactants) = 1 mol CaCl2 × (-795.8 kJ/mol) + 2 mol H2O × (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -795.8 kJ - 571.6 kJ = -1367.4 kJ

Finally, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of calcium chloride:

ΔH(reaction) = ΔH(products) - ΔH(reactants) = -1169.6 kJ - (-1367.4 kJ) = 197.8 kJ

The enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of calcium chloride is 197.8 kJ.
