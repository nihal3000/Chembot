Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose (C12H22O11) if it releases 5184 kJ/mol of energy.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, we can use the following formula:

ΔH = moles × energy released per mole

Given that the hydrolysis of 1 mole of sucrose releases 5184 kJ/mol of energy, we can plug in the values:

ΔH = 2 moles × 5184 kJ/mol

ΔH = 10368 kJ

Therefore, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose is 10368 kJ.
