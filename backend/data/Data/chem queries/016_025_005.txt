Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of dissolution (in kJ/mol) for NaCl in water, given that 1.00 g of NaCl is dissolved in 50.0 mL of water at 25°C. The density of water is 0.997 g/mL and the specific heat capacity of the solution is assumed to be the same as that of water (4.184 J/gK). The molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change of dissolution, we need to first find the heat absorbed or released by the solution when NaCl dissolves. We can do this using the formula:

q = mcΔT

where q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Since the specific heat capacity of the solution is assumed to be the same as that of water, we can use the given value of 4.184 J/gK. We also know that the mass of NaCl is 1.00 g, and the volume of water is 50.0 mL. We can find the mass of water using the given density:

mass of water = volume × density = 50.0 mL × 0.997 g/mL = 49.85 g

Now we can find the total mass of the solution:

mass of solution = mass of NaCl + mass of water = 1.00 g + 49.85 g = 50.85 g

Since the problem does not provide the change in temperature (ΔT), we will assume that the temperature remains constant at 25°C. This means that the heat absorbed or released by the solution (q) is zero.

Now we can calculate the moles of NaCl dissolved:

moles of NaCl = mass of NaCl / molar mass of NaCl = 1.00 g / 58.44 g/mol = 0.0171 mol

Finally, we can find the enthalpy change of dissolution (ΔH) using the formula:

ΔH = q / moles of NaCl = 0 J / 0.0171 mol = 0 kJ/mol

Since the heat absorbed or released by the solution is zero, the enthalpy change of dissolution for NaCl in water at 25°C is 0 kJ/mol.
