Enthalpy of desorption calculations
Calculate the amount of energy needed to desorb 10 moles of hydrogen gas from a metal surface, given that the enthalpy of desorption is -120 kJ/mol.
To calculate the amount of energy needed to desorb 10 moles of hydrogen gas from a metal surface, we can use the following formula:

Energy = moles × enthalpy of desorption

Given that the enthalpy of desorption is -120 kJ/mol, we need to reverse the sign to find the energy needed to desorb the hydrogen gas. So, the enthalpy of desorption becomes +120 kJ/mol.

Now, we can plug in the values:

Energy = 10 moles × 120 kJ/mol

Energy = 1200 kJ

Therefore, 1200 kJ of energy is needed to desorb 10 moles of hydrogen gas from the metal surface.
