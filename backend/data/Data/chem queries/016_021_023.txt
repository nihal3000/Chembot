Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction of ethylene, given that the heat of combustion of ethylene is -1411 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of formation of ethylene is +52.3 kJ/mol. The balanced equation for the polymerization of ethylene is:

nC2H4 -> [-C2H4-]n

Assume complete polymerization and that the standard enthalpy of formation of the polymer is negligible.
To calculate the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction of ethylene, we can use Hess's Law. According to Hess's Law, the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we can consider the polymerization reaction to occur in two steps:

1. Formation of ethylene from its elements (ΔHf)
2. Combustion of ethylene to form the polymer (ΔHc)

The overall enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction (ΔHr) can be calculated as follows:

ΔHr = ΔHf - ΔHc

Given that the enthalpy of formation of ethylene (ΔHf) is +52.3 kJ/mol and the heat of combustion of ethylene (ΔHc) is -1411 kJ/mol, we can calculate the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction (ΔHr):

ΔHr = 52.3 kJ/mol - (-1411 kJ/mol)
ΔHr = 52.3 kJ/mol + 1411 kJ/mol
ΔHr = 1463.3 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction of ethylene is +1463.3 kJ/mol.
