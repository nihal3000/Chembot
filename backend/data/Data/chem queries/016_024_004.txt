Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between aqueous solutions of 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M BaCl2, given that 50.0 mL of each solution were mixed in a calorimeter and the temperature of the mixture increased from 24.5°C to 29.3°C? Assume that the solution has the same density and specific heat capacity as water, and that the reaction goes to completion.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we first need to determine the heat absorbed or released by the reaction, which can be calculated using the formula:

q = mcΔT

where q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity of the solution, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Given that the density and specific heat capacity of the solution are the same as water, we can use the values for water: density = 1 g/mL and specific heat capacity (c) = 4.18 J/(g·°C).

First, let's find the mass of the solution. Since 50.0 mL of each solution were mixed, the total volume is 100.0 mL. Using the density of water, we can find the mass:

mass (m) = volume × density = 100.0 mL × 1 g/mL = 100.0 g

Now, we can calculate the change in temperature (ΔT):

ΔT = T_final - T_initial = 29.3°C - 24.5°C = 4.8°C

Next, we can calculate the heat absorbed or released (q) using the formula:

q = mcΔT = (100.0 g) × (4.18 J/(g·°C)) × (4.8°C) = 2009.6 J

Since the temperature increased, the reaction is exothermic, and the heat is released. Therefore, q = -2009.6 J.

Now, we need to determine the moles of the limiting reactant. The balanced equation for the precipitation reaction is:

Na2SO4(aq) + BaCl2(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + BaSO4(s)

Since both solutions have the same concentration (0.1 M) and volume (50.0 mL), we can calculate the moles of each reactant:

moles of Na2SO4 = (0.1 mol/L) × (0.050 L) = 0.005 mol
moles of BaCl2 = (0.1 mol/L) × (0.050 L) = 0.005 mol

Both reactants have the same number of moles, and since the stoichiometry is 1:1, neither reactant is in excess, and both are limiting reactants.

Finally, we can calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction by dividing the heat absorbed or released (q) by the moles of the limiting reactant:

ΔH = q / moles of limiting reactant = (-2009.6 J) / (0.005 mol) = -401920 J/mol

The enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between aqueous solutions of 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M BaCl2 is approximately -401.9 kJ/mol.
