Enthalpy of ionization calculations
What is the change in enthalpy (∆H) for the ionization of one mole of hydrogen gas (H2) to form two moles of hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solution? Given that the ionization energy of H2 is 1312 kJ/mol and the bond dissociation energy of H-H bond is 435 kJ/mol.
To calculate the change in enthalpy (∆H) for the ionization of one mole of hydrogen gas (H2) to form two moles of hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solution, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Breaking the H-H bond in H2 gas to form two hydrogen atoms.
2. Ionizing each hydrogen atom to form H+ ions.

Step 1: Breaking the H-H bond
The bond dissociation energy of the H-H bond is given as 435 kJ/mol. This is the energy required to break the bond and form two hydrogen atoms.

Step 2: Ionizing each hydrogen atom
The ionization energy of hydrogen is given as 1312 kJ/mol. Since we have two hydrogen atoms, the total energy required to ionize them is 2 * 1312 kJ/mol = 2624 kJ/mol.

Now, we can calculate the total change in enthalpy (∆H) for the ionization of one mole of hydrogen gas (H2) to form two moles of hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solution:

∆H = Energy required for breaking H-H bond + Energy required for ionizing hydrogen atoms
∆H = 435 kJ/mol + 2624 kJ/mol
∆H = 3059 kJ/mol

Therefore, the change in enthalpy (∆H) for the ionization of one mole of hydrogen gas (H2) to form two moles of hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solution is 3059 kJ/mol.
