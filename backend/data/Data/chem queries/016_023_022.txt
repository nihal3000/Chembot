Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose (C12H22O11) in aqueous solution given that the heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g.K, the initial and final temperatures of the solution are 22.0°C and 28.0°C respectively. The molar mass of sucrose is 342.3 g/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, we can use the formula:

ΔH = mcΔT

where ΔH is the enthalpy change, m is the mass of the solution, c is the heat capacity of the solution, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

First, let's find the mass of 2 moles of sucrose:

mass = moles × molar mass
mass = 2 moles × 342.3 g/mol
mass = 684.6 g

Now, let's find the change in temperature:

ΔT = T_final - T_initial
ΔT = 28.0°C - 22.0°C
ΔT = 6.0°C

Now we can calculate the enthalpy change:

ΔH = mcΔT
ΔH = (684.6 g)(4.18 J/g.K)(6.0°C)
ΔH = 17116.968 J

Since the enthalpy change is positive, the reaction is endothermic. The enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose in aqueous solution is 17,116.968 J or 17.12 kJ (rounded to two decimal places).
