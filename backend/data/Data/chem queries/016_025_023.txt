Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 g of sodium hydroxide in 100 g of water at a temperature of 25°C, given that the final temperature of the solution is 26.5°C and the specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J g⁻¹ K⁻¹. (Assume that the heat released is absorbed by the solution and there is no heat lost to the surroundings.)
To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of sodium hydroxide, we can use the formula:

q = mcΔT

where q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

First, let's find the mass of the solution. Since we have 10 g of sodium hydroxide and 100 g of water, the total mass of the solution is:

m = 10 g (NaOH) + 100 g (H2O) = 110 g

Next, we need to find the change in temperature. The initial temperature is 25°C and the final temperature is 26.5°C, so the change in temperature is:

ΔT = 26.5°C - 25°C = 1.5°C

Now we can plug the values into the formula:

q = (110 g) × (4.18 J g⁻¹ K⁻¹) × (1.5°C)

q = 688.47 J

Since the heat is released during the dissolution process, the enthalpy change is negative:

ΔH = -688.47 J

So, the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 g of sodium hydroxide in 100 g of water at 25°C is -688.47 J.
