Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
A student needs to find the enthalpy of polymerization of ethylene from the enthalpies of combustion of ethylene gas (-1411 kJ/mol) and polyethylene (-5120 kJ/mol). Calculate the enthalpy change, in kJ/mol, for the polymerization of ethylene gas to form polyethylene.
To find the enthalpy of polymerization of ethylene, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, regardless of the path taken. In this case, we can consider the combustion of ethylene gas and polyethylene as two separate reactions, and then find the difference in their enthalpies to determine the enthalpy of polymerization.

Let's represent the combustion reactions as follows:

1. Ethylene gas combustion:
   C2H4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)    ΔH1 = -1411 kJ/mol

2. Polyethylene combustion:
   [C2H4]n(s) + 3nO2(g) → 2nCO2(g) + 2nH2O(l)    ΔH2 = -5120 kJ/mol

We want to find the enthalpy change for the polymerization reaction:

3. Polymerization of ethylene gas:
   nC2H4(g) → [C2H4]n(s)    ΔH3 = ?

To find ΔH3, we can manipulate the combustion reactions (1) and (2) to get the desired reaction (3). We can do this by reversing reaction (1) and adding it to reaction (2):

-1 * [C2H4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)]    -ΔH1 = 1411 kJ/mol
+ [C2H4]n(s) + 3nO2(g) → 2nCO2(g) + 2nH2O(l)    ΔH2 = -5120 kJ/mol
--------------------------------------------------------------
nC2H4(g) → [C2H4]n(s)    ΔH3 = ?

Now, we can add the enthalpy changes for the manipulated reactions to find ΔH3:

ΔH3 = (-ΔH1) + ΔH2
ΔH3 = 1411 kJ/mol - 5120 kJ/mol
ΔH3 = -3709 kJ/mol

However, this value is for the polymerization of n moles of ethylene. To find the enthalpy change per mole of ethylene, we need to divide by n:

ΔH3 (per mole of ethylene) = -3709 kJ/mol / n

Since we are considering the polymerization of one mole of ethylene (n=1), the enthalpy change for the polymerization of ethylene gas to form polyethylene is:

ΔH3 (per mole of ethylene) = -3709 kJ/mol
