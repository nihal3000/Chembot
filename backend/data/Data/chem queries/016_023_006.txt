Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 0.1 moles of sucrose in water given the following information: 

- The enthalpy change of the reaction is -564 kJ/mol.
- The molar mass of sucrose is 342.3 g/mol.
- The reaction is exothermic.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 0.1 moles of sucrose, we can use the given enthalpy change of the reaction and the number of moles of sucrose.

Enthalpy change (ΔH) = moles of sucrose × enthalpy change per mole

Given:
Moles of sucrose = 0.1 moles
Enthalpy change per mole = -564 kJ/mol (exothermic, so negative value)

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 0.1 moles of sucrose:

ΔH = 0.1 moles × (-564 kJ/mol)
ΔH = -56.4 kJ

The enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 0.1 moles of sucrose in water is -56.4 kJ.
