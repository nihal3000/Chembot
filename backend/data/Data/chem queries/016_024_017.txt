Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
What is the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the precipitation reaction between aqueous solutions of barium chloride (BaCl₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) to form solid barium sulfate (BaSO₄) and aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl), given that 100.0 mL of 0.200 M BaCl₂ were mixed with 150.0 mL of 0.100 M H₂SO₄ at 25°C and that the resulting solution was allowed to come to equilibrium?
To determine the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the precipitation reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:

BaCl₂(aq) + H₂SO₄(aq) → BaSO₄(s) + 2HCl(aq)

Next, we need to determine the limiting reactant. We can do this by calculating the moles of each reactant:

moles of BaCl₂ = (0.200 mol/L) × (0.100 L) = 0.020 mol
moles of H₂SO₄ = (0.100 mol/L) × (0.150 L) = 0.015 mol

Since there is a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio between BaCl₂ and H₂SO₄, H₂SO₄ is the limiting reactant.

Now, we need to find the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction. Unfortunately, we cannot directly calculate the enthalpy change for this reaction without additional information, such as the enthalpy of formation values for the compounds involved.

However, if you have access to a table of standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°), you can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction using the following equation:

ΔH = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]

You would need to look up the standard enthalpies of formation for BaCl₂(aq), H₂SO₄(aq), BaSO₄(s), and HCl(aq) in a reference table and plug those values into the equation above. Then, multiply the enthalpy change by the moles of the limiting reactant (0.015 mol) to find the total enthalpy change for the reaction.
