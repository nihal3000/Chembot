Enthalpy of desorption calculations
What is the enthalpy of desorption for a sample of water molecules from the surface of sodium chloride, given that the temperature of the system is 298 K and the vapor pressure of water is 23.8 mm Hg? The surface area of the sample is 12.5 cmÂ² and the mass of the water molecules desorbed is 0.25 g. The enthalpy of vaporization for water is 40.7 kJ/mol and the lattice energy of sodium chloride is 786.5 kJ/mol. Assume that the desorption process is reversible and that the gas phase behaves ideally.
To calculate the enthalpy of desorption, we first need to find the number of moles of water molecules desorbed. 

1. Calculate the number of moles of water desorbed:
The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol. 

moles of water = mass of water / molar mass of water
moles of water = 0.25 g / 18.015 g/mol = 0.0139 mol

2. Calculate the enthalpy of vaporization for the desorbed water molecules:

Enthalpy of vaporization per mole = 40.7 kJ/mol

Total enthalpy of vaporization = moles of water * enthalpy of vaporization per mole
Total enthalpy of vaporization = 0.0139 mol * 40.7 kJ/mol = 0.5657 kJ

3. Calculate the enthalpy of desorption:

Since the desorption process is reversible and the gas phase behaves ideally, the enthalpy of desorption is equal to the enthalpy of vaporization for the desorbed water molecules.

Enthalpy of desorption = Total enthalpy of vaporization = 0.5657 kJ

The enthalpy of desorption for the sample of water molecules from the surface of sodium chloride is 0.5657 kJ.
