Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction of sucrose (C12H22O11) in water, given that the molar heat of combustion for sucrose is -5632 kJ/mol and the standard enthalpy of formation for liquid water is -285.83 kJ/mol?
To calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction of sucrose, we need to use Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can use the given information to set up a series of reactions and then calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction.

First, let's write the balanced hydrolysis reaction for sucrose:

C12H22O11 (s) + H2O (l) → 12C (s) + 11H2O (l)

Now, let's consider the combustion reaction for sucrose:

C12H22O11 (s) + 12O2 (g) → 12CO2 (g) + 11H2O (l)    ΔH_combustion = -5632 kJ/mol

We also have the standard enthalpy of formation for liquid water:

H2 (g) + 1/2O2 (g) → H2O (l)    ΔH_formation = -285.83 kJ/mol

We need to find the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction, so we need to manipulate these reactions to get the desired reaction. 

First, reverse the combustion reaction:

12CO2 (g) + 11H2O (l) → C12H22O11 (s) + 12O2 (g)    ΔH = +5632 kJ/mol

Next, multiply the enthalpy of formation reaction by 11 to match the number of water molecules in the hydrolysis reaction:

11[H2 (g) + 1/2O2 (g) → H2O (l)]    ΔH = 11(-285.83 kJ/mol) = -3144.13 kJ/mol

Now, add these two manipulated reactions:

12CO2 (g) + 11H2O (l) → C12H22O11 (s) + 12O2 (g)    ΔH = +5632 kJ/mol
11[H2 (g) + 1/2O2 (g) → H2O (l)]    ΔH = -3144.13 kJ/mol
--------------------------------------------------------------
C12H22O11 (s) + H2O (l) → 12C (s) + 11H2O (l)    ΔH_hydrolysis = ?

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction:

ΔH_hydrolysis = ΔH1 + ΔH2 = 5632 kJ/mol - 3144.13 kJ/mol = 2487.87 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction of sucrose is 2487.87 kJ/mol.
