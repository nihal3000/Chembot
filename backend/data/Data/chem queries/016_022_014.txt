Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Sure, here's a question for the chemistry student to solve:

Using the enthalpy of formation for the reactants and products given below, calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2:

Reactants:
- Butene-1 (C4H8) with enthalpy of formation = -23.67 kJ/mol

Products:
- Butene-2 (C4H8) with enthalpy of formation = -23.37 kJ/mol

Remember to properly balance the chemical equation and use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:

C4H8 (butene-1) → C4H8 (butene-2)

Since the reaction involves the conversion of one isomer to another, the balanced equation involves one mole of butene-1 converting to one mole of butene-2.

Now, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the formation of the reactants.

ΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)

In this case, we have:

ΔH_reaction = [1 * (-23.37 kJ/mol)] - [1 * (-23.67 kJ/mol)]

ΔH_reaction = (-23.37 kJ/mol) - (-23.67 kJ/mol)

ΔH_reaction = 0.30 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2 is 0.30 kJ/mol.
