Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
What is the enthalpy of polymerization of polystyrene if 25 grams of styrene monomer undergo polymerization at constant pressure and release 100 kJ of heat energy?
To calculate the enthalpy of polymerization of polystyrene, we need to determine the amount of heat released per mole of styrene monomer. First, we need to find the number of moles of styrene monomer in 25 grams.

The molecular weight of styrene (C8H8) is:
(8 x 12.01 g/mol for C) + (8 x 1.01 g/mol for H) = 104.15 g/mol

Now, we can find the number of moles of styrene monomer in 25 grams:
moles = mass / molecular weight
moles = 25 g / 104.15 g/mol = 0.240 mol

Since 100 kJ of heat energy is released during the polymerization of 0.240 mol of styrene monomer, we can calculate the enthalpy of polymerization per mole:

enthalpy of polymerization = heat energy released / moles of styrene monomer
enthalpy of polymerization = 100 kJ / 0.240 mol = 416.67 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy of polymerization of polystyrene is approximately 416.67 kJ/mol.
