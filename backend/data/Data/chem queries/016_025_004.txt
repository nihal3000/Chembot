Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
Sure! Here is a question for the student to solve:

What is the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of potassium nitrate (KNO3) in 100 grams of water at 25°C? Given the molar enthalpy of dissolution for KNO3 to be -34.01 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of potassium nitrate (KNO3) in 100 grams of water at 25°C, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of moles of KNO3.
2. Multiply the moles of KNO3 by the molar enthalpy of dissolution.

Step 1: Determine the number of moles of KNO3
The molar mass of KNO3 = 39.10 g/mol (K) + 14.01 g/mol (N) + 3 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 101.11 g/mol

Now, we can calculate the number of moles of KNO3:
moles = mass / molar mass
moles = 10 g / 101.11 g/mol = 0.0989 mol

Step 2: Multiply the moles of KNO3 by the molar enthalpy of dissolution
Enthalpy change = moles * molar enthalpy of dissolution
Enthalpy change = 0.0989 mol * (-34.01 kJ/mol) = -3.365 kJ

The enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of potassium nitrate (KNO3) in 100 grams of water at 25°C is approximately -3.365 kJ.
