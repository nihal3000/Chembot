Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2 given that the heat of combustion of butene-1 and butene-2 are -2874 kJ/mol and -2854 kJ/mol respectively. Assume all reactants and products are in the gaseous state and that the reaction is carried out at constant pressure.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2, we can use Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we can use the heat of combustion values for butene-1 and butene-2 to determine the enthalpy change for the isomerization reaction.

First, let's write the combustion reactions for butene-1 and butene-2:

Butene-1:
C4H8(g) + 6O2(g) → 4CO2(g) + 4H2O(l); ΔH1 = -2874 kJ/mol

Butene-2:
C4H8(g) + 6O2(g) → 4CO2(g) + 4H2O(l); ΔH2 = -2854 kJ/mol

Now, we want to find the enthalpy change for the isomerization reaction:

Butene-1(g) → Butene-2(g); ΔH = ?

To do this, we can use the combustion reactions to create a reaction pathway:

1. Butene-1(g) + 6O2(g) → 4CO2(g) + 4H2O(l); ΔH1 = -2874 kJ/mol
2. 4CO2(g) + 4H2O(l) → Butene-2(g) + 6O2(g); ΔH3 = -ΔH2 = 2854 kJ/mol

Now, we can add the two reactions together to get the isomerization reaction:

Butene-1(g) → Butene-2(g); ΔH = ΔH1 + ΔH3

ΔH = -2874 kJ/mol + 2854 kJ/mol = -20 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene-1 to butene-2 is -20 kJ/mol.
