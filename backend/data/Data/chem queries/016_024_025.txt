Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
What is the enthalpy change of precipitation for the reaction between 50 mL of 0.2 M barium chloride, BaCl2, and excess potassium sulfate, K2SO4, assuming all solutions are at 25°C and 1 atm pressure? The reaction equation is:

BaCl2(aq) + K2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2KCl(aq)

Given: Enthalpy change of formation of BaSO4(s) = -1465 kJ/mol, heat capacity of the calorimeter = 190 J/°C.
To find the enthalpy change of precipitation for the reaction, we first need to determine the number of moles of BaCl2 reacting.

The volume of BaCl2 solution is 50 mL, and its concentration is 0.2 M. To find the moles of BaCl2, we use the formula:

moles = volume × concentration

moles of BaCl2 = 50 mL × 0.2 mol/L = 0.01 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.002 mol

Since the reaction is a 1:1 ratio between BaCl2 and BaSO4, the moles of BaSO4 formed will also be 0.002 mol.

Now, we can use the given enthalpy change of formation of BaSO4 to find the enthalpy change for the reaction:

ΔH_reaction = moles of BaSO4 × ΔH_formation of BaSO4

ΔH_reaction = 0.002 mol × (-1465 kJ/mol) = -2.93 kJ

The enthalpy change of precipitation for the reaction between 50 mL of 0.2 M barium chloride and excess potassium sulfate is -2.93 kJ.
