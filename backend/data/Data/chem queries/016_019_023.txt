Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the adsorption of 30 grams of nitrogen gas on the surface of activated charcoal at a temperature of 25°C?

Given values:
- Mass of nitrogen gas adsorbed = 30 grams
- Temperature = 25°C
- Enthalpy of adsorption of nitrogen on activated charcoal = -72 kJ/mol
To calculate the enthalpy change for the adsorption of 30 grams of nitrogen gas on the surface of activated charcoal, we need to first determine the number of moles of nitrogen gas and then use the given enthalpy of adsorption value.

1. Calculate the number of moles of nitrogen gas:
Nitrogen gas (N₂) has a molar mass of 28 grams/mol (14 g/mol for each nitrogen atom, and there are two nitrogen atoms in a molecule of nitrogen gas).

Number of moles = mass / molar mass
Number of moles = 30 grams / 28 grams/mol
Number of moles ≈ 1.071 moles of nitrogen gas

2. Calculate the enthalpy change:
Enthalpy change = number of moles × enthalpy of adsorption per mole

Enthalpy change = 1.071 moles × -72 kJ/mol
Enthalpy change ≈ -77.112 kJ

The enthalpy change for the adsorption of 30 grams of nitrogen gas on the surface of activated charcoal at 25°C is approximately -77.112 kJ.
