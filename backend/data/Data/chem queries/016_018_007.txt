Enthalpy of ionization calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the ionization of a 1 mol/L solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 25 °C, given that the pH of the solution is 1.5?
To calculate the enthalpy change for the ionization of a 1 mol/L solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 25 °C, we need to consider the following reaction:

HCl(aq) → H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)

First, let's find the concentration of H⁺ ions in the solution using the pH value:

pH = -log[H⁺]

1.5 = -log[H⁺]

[H⁺] = 10^(-1.5) = 0.0316 mol/L

Now, we need to find the degree of ionization (α) of HCl:

α = [H⁺] / [HCl_initial]

α = 0.0316 / 1

α = 0.0316

Since HCl is a strong acid, it ionizes completely in water, and the degree of ionization should be close to 1. However, the given pH value indicates that the degree of ionization is 0.0316, which is not consistent with the behavior of a strong acid like HCl. Therefore, the problem statement seems to be incorrect or contradictory.

Assuming that HCl ionizes completely (α = 1), we can calculate the enthalpy change using the standard enthalpy of formation for HCl(aq), H⁺(aq), and Cl⁻(aq). The standard enthalpy of formation for HCl(aq) is -167.2 kJ/mol, while the standard enthalpy of formation for H⁺(aq) and Cl⁻(aq) are 0 kJ/mol (by definition).

ΔH = [ΔH_f(H⁺) + ΔH_f(Cl⁻)] - ΔH_f(HCl)

ΔH = [(0 + 0) - (-167.2)] kJ/mol

ΔH = 167.2 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy change for the ionization of a 1 mol/L solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 25 °C would be 167.2 kJ/mol, assuming complete ionization.
