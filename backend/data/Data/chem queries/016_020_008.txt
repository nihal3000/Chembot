Enthalpy of desorption calculations
What is the enthalpy change when calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2•2H2O) is heated to release its water of hydration, given that the enthalpy of formation of CaCl2 is -795.8 kJ/mol and the heat capacity of CaCl2•2H2O is 155.09 J/(mol K)?
To calculate the enthalpy change when calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2•2H2O) is heated to release its water of hydration, we need to consider the enthalpy change of the reaction:

CaCl2•2H2O (s) → CaCl2 (s) + 2H2O (g)

First, we need to find the enthalpy of formation of CaCl2•2H2O. We know the enthalpy of formation of CaCl2 is -795.8 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of formation of water (H2O) is -285.8 kJ/mol. Therefore, the enthalpy of formation of CaCl2•2H2O can be calculated as follows:

ΔHf (CaCl2•2H2O) = ΔHf (CaCl2) + 2 * ΔHf (H2O)
ΔHf (CaCl2•2H2O) = -795.8 kJ/mol + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)
ΔHf (CaCl2•2H2O) = -1367.4 kJ/mol

Now, we need to find the enthalpy change of the reaction (ΔHrxn). To do this, we can use the following equation:

ΔHrxn = ΔHf (products) - ΔHf (reactants)

In this case, the products are CaCl2 and 2H2O, and the reactant is CaCl2•2H2O. Plugging in the values, we get:

ΔHrxn = (ΔHf (CaCl2) + 2 * ΔHf (H2O)) - ΔHf (CaCl2•2H2O)
ΔHrxn = (-795.8 kJ/mol + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)) - (-1367.4 kJ/mol)
ΔHrxn = 44 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy change when calcium chloride dihydrate is heated to release its water of hydration is approximately 44 kJ/mol.
