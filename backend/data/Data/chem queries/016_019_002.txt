Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the adsorption of nitrogen gas on the surface of activated charcoal, given that the adsorption pressure is 1 atm at a temperature of 298 K. The quantity of nitrogen gas adsorbed is 0.01 moles per gram of charcoal, and the heat of combustion of the same amount of charcoal is -35.4 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the adsorption of nitrogen gas on the surface of activated charcoal, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the pressure, temperature, and enthalpy change of a process:

ln(P2/P1) = -ΔH/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

In this case, we have the following information:

P1 = 1 atm (initial pressure)
P2 = 0 atm (final pressure, since the nitrogen gas is adsorbed onto the charcoal)
T1 = 298 K (initial temperature)
T2 = 298 K (final temperature, assuming no temperature change during the process)
R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) (universal gas constant)

We can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(0/1) = -ΔH/8.314 * (1/298 - 1/298)

Since ln(0) is undefined, we cannot use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation directly in this case. However, we can make an approximation by considering the process to be isothermal (constant temperature) and use the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst), which is the enthalpy change for the adsorption process at constant temperature.

Qst = -n * ΔH_ads

Where n is the amount of nitrogen gas adsorbed (0.01 moles/g) and ΔH_ads is the enthalpy change for the adsorption process.

We are also given the heat of combustion of the charcoal, which is -35.4 kJ/mol. Since the heat of combustion is the energy released when 1 mole of charcoal is burned, we can use this value to calculate the energy released during the adsorption process:

Energy_released = -35.4 kJ/mol * 0.01 moles/g

Energy_released = -0.354 kJ/g

Now, we can use the energy released and the isosteric heat of adsorption to calculate the enthalpy change for the adsorption process:

Qst = -n * ΔH_ads
-0.354 kJ/g = -(0.01 moles/g) * ΔH_ads

ΔH_ads = -0.354 kJ/g / (-0.01 moles/g)

ΔH_ads = 35.4 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the adsorption of nitrogen gas on the surface of activated charcoal is 35.4 kJ/mol.
