Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
Determine the enthalpy of hydrolysis for sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2) given that the enthalpy of neutralization for acetic acid (HC2H3O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is -55.9 kJ/mol and the heat of formation for NaC2H3O2 is -382.7 kJ/mol.
To determine the enthalpy of hydrolysis for sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2), we need to consider the reactions involved in the process. The hydrolysis of sodium acetate can be represented by the following equation:

NaC2H3O2 (aq) + H2O (l) → HC2H3O2 (aq) + NaOH (aq)

The enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH_hydrolysis) can be calculated using Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, whether it occurs in one step or several steps. We can use the given enthalpy values for the neutralization of acetic acid and sodium hydroxide and the heat of formation for sodium acetate to find the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction.

First, let's consider the neutralization reaction:

HC2H3O2 (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaC2H3O2 (aq) + H2O (l)      ΔH_neutralization = -55.9 kJ/mol

Now, we need to reverse this reaction to get the formation reaction for sodium acetate:

NaC2H3O2 (aq) + H2O (l) → HC2H3O2 (aq) + NaOH (aq)      ΔH_formation = -(-55.9 kJ/mol) = 55.9 kJ/mol

Now, we can use the heat of formation for sodium acetate (-382.7 kJ/mol) and the enthalpy change for the formation reaction (55.9 kJ/mol) to find the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis reaction:

ΔH_hydrolysis = ΔH_formation - ΔH_neutralization

ΔH_hydrolysis = (-382.7 kJ/mol) - (55.9 kJ/mol)

ΔH_hydrolysis = -438.6 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy of hydrolysis for sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2) is -438.6 kJ/mol.
