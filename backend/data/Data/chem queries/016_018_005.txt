Enthalpy of ionization calculations
What is the enthalpy change of ionization of magnesium if 125 kJ of energy is required to completely remove one electron from a magnesium atom?
The enthalpy change of ionization, also known as ionization energy, is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom or ion in its gaseous state. In this case, the enthalpy change of ionization for magnesium is given as 125 kJ/mol for the removal of one electron from a magnesium atom.

The ionization process can be represented as:

Mg(g) → Mg⁺(g) + e⁻

The enthalpy change of ionization for this process is 125 kJ/mol.
