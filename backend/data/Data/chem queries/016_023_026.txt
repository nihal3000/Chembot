Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose (C12H22O11) in aqueous solution, given the following information:
- ΔHf(C12H22O11) = -564.8 kJ/mol
- ΔHf(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol
- ΔH°rxn for the hydrolysis of sucrose = -126.3 kJ/mol.
To find the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose, we can use the given ΔH°rxn for the hydrolysis of sucrose, which is -126.3 kJ/mol. Since we have 2 moles of sucrose, we can simply multiply the ΔH°rxn by the number of moles:

ΔH = ΔH°rxn × moles of sucrose
ΔH = (-126.3 kJ/mol) × 2 moles
ΔH = -252.6 kJ

So, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 2 moles of sucrose in aqueous solution is -252.6 kJ.
