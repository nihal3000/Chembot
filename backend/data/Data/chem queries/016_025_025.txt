Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
What is the enthalpy change, in kilojoules per mole, when 6.0 grams of potassium chloride (KCl) is dissolved in 200.0 mL of water at 25°C? The molar heat of dissolution of KCl is -57.3 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change, we first need to determine the number of moles of KCl being dissolved. 

The molar mass of KCl is:
K = 39.1 g/mol
Cl = 35.5 g/mol
KCl = 39.1 + 35.5 = 74.6 g/mol

Now we can find the number of moles of KCl:
moles = mass / molar mass
moles = 6.0 g / 74.6 g/mol = 0.0804 mol

Next, we can use the molar heat of dissolution to find the enthalpy change:
enthalpy change = moles × molar heat of dissolution
enthalpy change = 0.0804 mol × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -4.61 kJ

The enthalpy change when 6.0 grams of potassium chloride is dissolved in 200.0 mL of water at 25°C is -4.61 kJ.
