Enthalpy of desorption calculations
What is the enthalpy change when 2.5 grams of water vapor desorbs at a constant temperature of 25°C from a surface with a surface area of 30 cm² covered with adsorbed water molecules? The surface was initially at a temperature of 60°C and it was cooled down to 25°C after the adsorption of water molecules. The heat capacity of the adsorbent surface is 45 J/°C and the molar enthalpy of vaporization of water is 40.7 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change when 2.5 grams of water vapor desorbs from the surface, we need to consider two processes: the cooling of the surface from 60°C to 25°C and the desorption of water vapor at 25°C.

1. Cooling of the surface:
The heat capacity of the adsorbent surface is given as 45 J/°C. The temperature change is from 60°C to 25°C, which is a decrease of 35°C.

q1 (heat released during cooling) = heat capacity × temperature change
q1 = 45 J/°C × 35°C
q1 = 1575 J

2. Desorption of water vapor:
First, we need to find the number of moles of water vapor desorbed. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.

moles of water = mass / molar mass
moles of water = 2.5 g / 18.015 g/mol
moles of water ≈ 0.1387 mol

The molar enthalpy of vaporization of water is given as 40.7 kJ/mol. To find the enthalpy change for the desorption of 0.1387 mol of water vapor, we can use the following equation:

q2 (heat absorbed during desorption) = moles of water × molar enthalpy of vaporization
q2 = 0.1387 mol × 40.7 kJ/mol
q2 ≈ 5.645 kJ

Now, we need to convert q2 to Joules (1 kJ = 1000 J):

q2 ≈ 5.645 kJ × 1000 J/kJ
q2 ≈ 5645 J

Since the surface releases heat during cooling and absorbs heat during desorption, the total enthalpy change (ΔH) is the sum of the two processes:

ΔH = q1 - q2
ΔH = 1575 J - 5645 J
ΔH = -4070 J

The enthalpy change when 2.5 grams of water vapor desorbs from the surface is -4070 J.
