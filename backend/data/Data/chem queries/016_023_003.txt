Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 1 mole of magnesium chloride? Given the reaction: MgCl2 + 2H2O → Mg(OH)2 + 2HCl. The enthalpy change for the reaction Mg(OH)2 + 2HCl → MgCl2 + 2H2O is -94.5 kJ/mol.
To find the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 1 mole of magnesium chloride, we can use the given enthalpy change for the reverse reaction and change its sign.

The given reaction is:
Mg(OH)2 + 2HCl → MgCl2 + 2H2O, ΔH = -94.5 kJ/mol

The reverse reaction (hydrolysis of magnesium chloride) is:
MgCl2 + 2H2O → Mg(OH)2 + 2HCl

Since the reverse reaction is the opposite of the given reaction, the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of 1 mole of magnesium chloride will be the opposite sign of the given enthalpy change.

ΔH (hydrolysis) = +94.5 kJ/mol
