Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
What is the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction of ethylene? The combustion of ethylene produces -1411 kJ/mol, and the combustion of polyethylene produces -2385 kJ/mol. Given that the enthalpy change of the reaction is independent of the reaction pathway, calculate the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction of ethylene.
To calculate the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction of ethylene, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is independent of the reaction pathway. We can use the combustion reactions of ethylene and polyethylene to determine the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction.

Let's consider the following reactions:

1. Combustion of ethylene:
   C2H4 (g) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l); ΔH1 = -1411 kJ/mol

2. Combustion of polyethylene:
   -[C2H4]n (s) + 3n O2 (g) → 2n CO2 (g) + 2n H2O (l); ΔH2 = -2385 kJ/mol

We want to find the enthalpy change for the polymerization reaction:

3. Polymerization of ethylene:
   n C2H4 (g) → -[C2H4]n (s); ΔH3 = ?

Using Hess's Law, we can manipulate the given reactions to find the enthalpy change for the polymerization reaction:

ΔH3 = ΔH2 - nΔH1

Since we are considering the polymerization of one mole of ethylene (n = 1):

ΔH3 = -2385 kJ/mol - (-1411 kJ/mol)
ΔH3 = -2385 + 1411
ΔH3 = -974 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy change of the polymerization reaction of ethylene is -974 kJ/mol.
