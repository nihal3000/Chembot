Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of NaCl in 100 mL of water at 25°C given that the enthalpy of solution of NaCl is -3.9 kJ/mol?
To calculate the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of NaCl in 100 mL of water, we need to first determine the number of moles of NaCl and then use the enthalpy of solution to find the total enthalpy change.

1. Calculate the number of moles of NaCl:
The molar mass of NaCl = 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol for Na + 35.45 g/mol for Cl)
Number of moles = mass / molar mass
Number of moles = 10 g / 58.44 g/mol = 0.171 moles

2. Calculate the enthalpy change:
Enthalpy change = number of moles × enthalpy of solution
Enthalpy change = 0.171 moles × (-3.9 kJ/mol) = -0.667 kJ

The enthalpy change for the dissolution of 10 grams of NaCl in 100 mL of water at 25°C is -0.667 kJ.
