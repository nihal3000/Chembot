Enthalpy of ionization calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the ionization of one mole of magnesium in the gas phase, given that the ionization energy of magnesium is 738 kJ/mol and the electron affinity of magnesium is -50.1 kJ/mol? Show your work and include units in your answer.
The enthalpy change for the ionization of one mole of magnesium in the gas phase can be calculated using the ionization energy and electron affinity values given.

Ionization energy is the energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms, while electron affinity is the energy change when one mole of electrons is added to one mole of gaseous atoms.

In this case, we are given the ionization energy of magnesium (738 kJ/mol) and the electron affinity of magnesium (-50.1 kJ/mol). Since the electron affinity is negative, it means that energy is released when an electron is added to magnesium.

The enthalpy change for the ionization of magnesium can be calculated as follows:

Enthalpy change = Ionization energy + Electron affinity
Enthalpy change = 738 kJ/mol + (-50.1 kJ/mol)
Enthalpy change = 738 kJ/mol - 50.1 kJ/mol
Enthalpy change = 687.9 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy change for the ionization of one mole of magnesium in the gas phase is 687.9 kJ/mol.
