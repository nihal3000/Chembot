Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of isomerization for the reaction of cis-2-butene to its trans counterpart. Given the following information: 

- Heat of combustion of cis-2-butene = -3338.9 kJ/mol
- Heat of combustion of trans-2-butene = -3478.6 kJ/mol
- Heat of combustion of butane = -2877.2 kJ/mol
To calculate the enthalpy of isomerization for the reaction of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene, we can use Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we can use the heat of combustion values provided to calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization reaction.

First, let's write the combustion reactions for cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene, and butane:

1. cis-2-butene + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O (ΔH = -3338.9 kJ/mol)
2. trans-2-butene + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O (ΔH = -3478.6 kJ/mol)
3. butane + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O (ΔH = -2877.2 kJ/mol)

Now, we want to manipulate these reactions to obtain the isomerization reaction:

cis-2-butene → trans-2-butene

To do this, we can reverse reaction 1 and add it to reaction 2:

1. CO₂ + H₂O → cis-2-butene + O₂ (ΔH = +3338.9 kJ/mol)
2. trans-2-butene + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O (ΔH = -3478.6 kJ/mol)

Adding these two reactions, we get:

cis-2-butene → trans-2-butene (ΔH = -3478.6 + 3338.9)

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization reaction:

ΔH = -3478.6 kJ/mol + 3338.9 kJ/mol = -139.7 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy of isomerization for the reaction of cis-2-butene to its trans counterpart is -139.7 kJ/mol.
