Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between 25.0 mL of 0.100 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) and excess calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution at 25°C. The balanced equation for the reaction is:

AgNO3(aq) + CaCl2(aq) → AgCl(s) + Ca(NO3)2(aq)

Assume the density of the solutions is equal to 1.00 g/mL and the solutions have the same specific heat as water (4.18 J/g°C).
To calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we first need to determine the moles of AgNO3 reacting and then use the enthalpy of formation values for the reactants and products.

1. Calculate the moles of AgNO3:
moles = Molarity × Volume
moles of AgNO3 = 0.100 mol/L × 0.025 L = 0.00250 mol

2. Use the balanced equation to determine the stoichiometry of the reaction:
1 mol AgNO3 reacts with 1 mol CaCl2 to produce 1 mol AgCl and 1 mol Ca(NO3)2.

3. Look up the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) values for the reactants and products:
ΔHf° (AgNO3) = -124.4 kJ/mol
ΔHf° (CaCl2) = -795.4 kJ/mol
ΔHf° (AgCl) = -127.0 kJ/mol
ΔHf° (Ca(NO3)2) = -814.0 kJ/mol

4. Calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔHrxn) using the following equation:
ΔHrxn = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]

ΔHrxn = [(1 mol AgCl × -127.0 kJ/mol) + (1 mol Ca(NO3)2 × -814.0 kJ/mol)] - [(1 mol AgNO3 × -124.4 kJ/mol) + (1 mol CaCl2 × -795.4 kJ/mol)]

ΔHrxn = (-127.0 kJ + -814.0 kJ) - (-124.4 kJ + -795.4 kJ)
ΔHrxn = (-941.0 kJ) - (-919.8 kJ)
ΔHrxn = -21.2 kJ/mol

5. Calculate the enthalpy change for the given amount of AgNO3:
ΔH = ΔHrxn × moles of AgNO3
ΔH = -21.2 kJ/mol × 0.00250 mol
ΔH = -0.0530 kJ

The enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between 25.0 mL of 0.100 M silver nitrate and excess calcium chloride solution at 25°C is -0.0530 kJ.
