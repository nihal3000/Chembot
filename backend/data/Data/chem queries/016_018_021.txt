Enthalpy of ionization calculations
What is the enthalpy of ionization of magnesium if it requires 576 kJ/mol of energy to completely remove one electron from a gaseous magnesium atom?
The enthalpy of ionization, also known as ionization energy, is the energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion. In this case, we are given the energy required to remove one electron from a gaseous magnesium atom, which is 576 kJ/mol.

The enthalpy of ionization of magnesium (Mg) can be represented as:

Mg(g) → Mg⁺(g) + e⁻

The ionization energy for this process is given as 576 kJ/mol. Therefore, the enthalpy of ionization of magnesium is 576 kJ/mol.
