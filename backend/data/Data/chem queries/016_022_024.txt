Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization reaction of butene-1 to cis-2-butene. Given that the standard enthalpy of formation for butene-1 is -19.8 kJ/mol and for cis-2-butene is -20.4 kJ/mol, and the standard enthalpy of combustion for butene-1 is -2876 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization reaction of butene-1 to cis-2-butene, we can use the following formula:

ΔH_reaction = ΔH_f(products) - ΔH_f(reactants)

In this case, the reactant is butene-1 and the product is cis-2-butene. We are given the standard enthalpy of formation for both butene-1 and cis-2-butene:

ΔH_f(butene-1) = -19.8 kJ/mol
ΔH_f(cis-2-butene) = -20.4 kJ/mol

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:

ΔH_reaction = (-20.4 kJ/mol) - (-19.8 kJ/mol)

ΔH_reaction = -0.6 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy change for the isomerization reaction of butene-1 to cis-2-butene is -0.6 kJ/mol.
