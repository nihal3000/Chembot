Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Sure! Here's a precise problem a chemistry student can solve:

Calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of but-2-ene to 2-methylpropene given the following bond dissociation energy values:

C-C single bond = 356 kJ/mol

C=C double bond = 612 kJ/mol

C-H bond = 413 kJ/mol

Hint: Make sure to draw the molecular structure of but-2-ene and 2-methylpropene to determine the bonds broken and formed during the isomerization process, then use bond dissociation energy values to calculate the enthalpy change.
First, let's draw the molecular structures of but-2-ene and 2-methylpropene:

But-2-ene: H2C=CH-CH2-CH3
2-methylpropene: H2C=C(CH3)-CH3

Now, let's determine the bonds broken and formed during the isomerization process:

Bonds broken in but-2-ene:
1 C=C double bond
5 C-H bonds
2 C-C single bonds

Bonds formed in 2-methylpropene:
1 C=C double bond
6 C-H bonds
1 C-C single bond

Now, we can use the bond dissociation energy values to calculate the enthalpy change:

Enthalpy change = Σ(bonds broken) - Σ(bonds formed)

Enthalpy change = [(1 × 612) + (5 × 413) + (2 × 356)] - [(1 × 612) + (6 × 413) + (1 × 356)]

Enthalpy change = (612 + 2065 + 712) - (612 + 2478 + 356)

Enthalpy change = 3389 - 3446

Enthalpy change = -57 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the isomerization of but-2-ene to 2-methylpropene is -57 kJ/mol.
