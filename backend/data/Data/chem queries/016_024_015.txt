Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction between aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and potassium chloride, given that 50.0 mL of 0.100 M silver nitrate and 50.0 mL of 0.100 M potassium chloride were mixed together and the resulting solution had a final temperature of 25.0 °C? The heat capacity of the calorimeter is negligible. 

AgNO3(aq) + KCl(aq) -> AgCl(s) + KNO3(aq)
To determine the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we first need to find the heat (q) released or absorbed during the reaction. Since the heat capacity of the calorimeter is negligible, we can assume that the heat released or absorbed by the reaction is equal to the heat absorbed or released by the solution.

The specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g·°C. Since the final temperature of the solution is 25.0 °C, we can assume that the initial temperature of both solutions was also 25.0 °C, and there was no temperature change during the reaction. Therefore, the heat (q) released or absorbed during the reaction is 0 J.

Since there is no heat change during the reaction, the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the precipitation reaction between aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and potassium chloride is also 0 J.
