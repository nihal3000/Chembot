Enthalpy of desorption calculations
What is the enthalpy of desorption of water from a silica surface at a temperature of 298 K, given that the vapor pressure of water at this temperature is 23.756 torr and the adsorption energy of water on silica is 54.6 kJ/mol? Calculate the enthalpy of desorption in kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy of desorption, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and enthalpy of vaporization:

ln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

In this case, we are given the vapor pressure of water at 298 K (P2) and the adsorption energy of water on silica (ΔHads). We need to find the enthalpy of desorption (ΔHdes) and the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of desorption (P1). 

Since the enthalpy of desorption is the opposite of the adsorption energy, we can write:

ΔHdes = -ΔHads

ΔHdes = -54.6 kJ/mol

Now, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of desorption (P1). We will assume that the enthalpy of vaporization of water (ΔHvap) is constant at 40.7 kJ/mol, and the gas constant (R) is 8.314 J/(mol*K).

ln(P1/23.756) = -(-54.6 * 1000)/(8.314 * 298)

P1 = 23.756 * exp(54.6 * 1000 / (8.314 * 298))

P1 ≈ 1.16 * 10^6 torr

Now that we have the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of desorption, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again to find the enthalpy of desorption:

ln(23.756/1.16 * 10^6) = -ΔHdes/R * (1/298 - 1/T1)

Solving for T1, we get:

T1 ≈ 373 K

Now, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation one more time to find the enthalpy of desorption:

ln(23.756/1.16 * 10^6) = -ΔHdes/(8.314) * (1/298 - 1/373)

Solving for ΔHdes, we get:

ΔHdes ≈ 54.6 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy of desorption of water from a silica surface at a temperature of 298 K is approximately 54.6 kJ/mol.
