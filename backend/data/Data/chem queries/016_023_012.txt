Enthalpy of hydrolysis calculations
What is the change in enthalpy for the hydrolysis of 5 moles of sucrose (table sugar) into glucose and fructose at a constant pressure of 1 atm and 25°C? The balanced chemical equation for the hydrolysis of sucrose is C12H22O11 + H2O → C6H12O6 + C6H12O6. Given the enthalpies of formation for sucrose, glucose, and fructose, calculate the change in enthalpy of the reaction.
To calculate the change in enthalpy for the hydrolysis of sucrose, we need the enthalpies of formation for sucrose, glucose, and fructose. Please provide the enthalpies of formation for these compounds.
