Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
What is the enthalpy change of polymerization of styrene if 2.5 g of styrene monomer is polymerized using 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a solvent and 0.2 g of a free radical initiator? The reaction was carried out in a bomb calorimeter, and the temperature increased from 25°C to 48°C. The heat capacity of the calorimeter is 1.6 kJ/°C, and the density of THF is 0.89 g/mL.
To calculate the enthalpy change of the polymerization of styrene, we first need to determine the heat released during the reaction. We can do this using the temperature change and the heat capacity of the calorimeter.

ΔT = T_final - T_initial = 48°C - 25°C = 23°C

Heat released (q) = heat capacity of the calorimeter × ΔT
q = 1.6 kJ/°C × 23°C = 36.8 kJ

Now, we need to find the moles of styrene monomer. The molecular weight of styrene is approximately 104 g/mol.

moles of styrene = mass of styrene / molecular weight of styrene
moles of styrene = 2.5 g / 104 g/mol ≈ 0.02404 mol

Finally, we can calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) per mole of styrene:

ΔH = q / moles of styrene
ΔH = 36.8 kJ / 0.02404 mol ≈ 1531 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change of polymerization of styrene is approximately 1531 kJ/mol.
