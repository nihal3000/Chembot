Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
What is the enthalpy change when 50.0 grams of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is dissolved in 250.0 mL of water at 25°C? The molar enthalpy of dissolution of NH4Cl is -14.8 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change, we first need to determine the number of moles of NH4Cl in 50.0 grams. The molar mass of NH4Cl is:

Molar mass of NH4Cl = 14.01 (N) + 4 * 1.01 (H) + 35.45 (Cl) = 53.49 g/mol

Now, we can find the number of moles of NH4Cl:

moles of NH4Cl = mass / molar mass = 50.0 g / 53.49 g/mol = 0.934 mol

Next, we can use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to find the enthalpy change:

Enthalpy change = moles * molar enthalpy of dissolution = 0.934 mol * (-14.8 kJ/mol) = -13.82 kJ

Therefore, the enthalpy change when 50.0 grams of ammonium chloride is dissolved in 250.0 mL of water at 25°C is -13.82 kJ.
