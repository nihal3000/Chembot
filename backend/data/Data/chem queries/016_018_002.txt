Enthalpy of ionization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change (in kJ/mol) for the ionization of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) given the following information: 

H2SO4 (l) → H+ (aq) + HSO4- (aq)
ΔH1 = +1009 kJ/mol
HSO4- (aq) → H+ (aq) + SO4^2- (aq)
ΔH2 = +513 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the ionization of sulfuric acid, we need to add the enthalpy changes for the two steps involved in the process:

1. H2SO4 (l) → H+ (aq) + HSO4- (aq) with ΔH1 = +1009 kJ/mol
2. HSO4- (aq) → H+ (aq) + SO4^2- (aq) with ΔH2 = +513 kJ/mol

The overall reaction is:
H2SO4 (l) → 2H+ (aq) + SO4^2- (aq)

The enthalpy change for the overall reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for the two steps:

ΔH_total = ΔH1 + ΔH2
ΔH_total = (+1009 kJ/mol) + (+513 kJ/mol)
ΔH_total = +1522 kJ/mol

So, the enthalpy change for the ionization of sulfuric acid is +1522 kJ/mol.
