Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of polymerization for the reaction of ethylene (C2H4) to polyethylene (C2H4)n, given that the enthalpy of combustion for ethylene is -1411 kJ/mol and the number of moles of ethylene used in the reaction is 4.5 mol. Assume that the reaction is exothermic and that the enthalpy change is constant over the extent of the reaction.
To calculate the enthalpy of polymerization for the reaction of ethylene to polyethylene, we need to determine the enthalpy change per mole of ethylene used in the reaction. Since the enthalpy of combustion for ethylene is given, we can use this information to determine the enthalpy change for the polymerization reaction.

Enthalpy of combustion of ethylene (ΔH_combustion) = -1411 kJ/mol
Number of moles of ethylene (n) = 4.5 mol

The enthalpy of combustion represents the energy released when one mole of ethylene is completely combusted. However, we are interested in the enthalpy change for the polymerization reaction, which is a different process. To find the enthalpy of polymerization (ΔH_polymerization), we can use the following relationship:

ΔH_polymerization = -ΔH_combustion

This relationship is based on the assumption that the enthalpy change for the polymerization reaction is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction.

Now we can calculate the enthalpy of polymerization:

ΔH_polymerization = -(-1411 kJ/mol) = 1411 kJ/mol

This value represents the enthalpy change per mole of ethylene used in the polymerization reaction. To find the total enthalpy change for the 4.5 moles of ethylene used, we can multiply the enthalpy change per mole by the number of moles:

Total enthalpy change = ΔH_polymerization × n = 1411 kJ/mol × 4.5 mol = 6349.5 kJ

Therefore, the enthalpy of polymerization for the reaction of ethylene to polyethylene using 4.5 moles of ethylene is 6349.5 kJ.
