Enthalpy of ionization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of ionization of magnesium if 50 mL of 0.1 M HCl solution is added to 1 g of magnesium powder at 25°C, and the change in temperature is -10°C. The specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J•g-1•K-1.
First, we need to determine the amount of heat released during the reaction. We can do this using the formula:

q = mcΔT

where q is the heat released, m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Since the density of the solution is not given, we will assume it is approximately equal to the density of water, which is 1 g/mL. Therefore, the mass of the 50 mL solution is:

m = 50 mL * 1 g/mL = 50 g

Now we can calculate the heat released:

q = (50 g)(4.18 J/g•K)(-10°C) = -2090 J

The heat released is negative because the reaction is exothermic (the temperature decreased).

Next, we need to determine the moles of magnesium reacting. The molar mass of magnesium is 24.31 g/mol. So, the moles of magnesium in 1 g of magnesium powder are:

moles of Mg = 1 g / 24.31 g/mol = 0.0411 mol

Now we can calculate the enthalpy of ionization of magnesium. The enthalpy of ionization is the heat released per mole of magnesium ionized. We can find this by dividing the heat released by the moles of magnesium:

ΔH_ionization = q / moles of Mg = -2090 J / 0.0411 mol = -50800 J/mol

The enthalpy of ionization of magnesium is -50.8 kJ/mol.
