Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of the polymerization of styrene using the following information: 

Reactants: 
- Styrene: C8H8 (l) 
- Peroxide initiator: C6H5OOC(CH3)3 (l) 

Products: 
- Polystyrene: (C8H8)n (s)
- Byproduct: CO2 (g)

Given information: 
- Heat of formation of CO2 (g) = -393.5 kJ/mol 
- Mass of styrene used = 50 g 
- Molarity of the initiator solution = 0.3 M 
- Volume of the initiator solution used = 25 mL 
- Density of the initiator solution = 0.89 g/mL 
- The reaction is carried out at a constant pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of 25Â°C.
To calculate the enthalpy change of the polymerization of styrene, we need to find the moles of styrene and the moles of CO2 produced. Then, we can use the heat of formation of CO2 to find the enthalpy change.

1. Calculate the moles of styrene used:
Molecular weight of styrene (C8H8) = (8 * 12.01) + (8 * 1.01) = 104.15 g/mol
Moles of styrene = mass of styrene / molecular weight of styrene
Moles of styrene = 50 g / 104.15 g/mol = 0.480 mol

2. Calculate the moles of initiator used:
Moles of initiator = Molarity * Volume
Moles of initiator = 0.3 M * 0.025 L = 0.0075 mol

3. Assume that the reaction goes to completion and all the styrene is converted to polystyrene and CO2. Since the initiator is used to start the reaction, it does not affect the stoichiometry of the reaction. Therefore, the moles of CO2 produced will be equal to the moles of styrene used.

Moles of CO2 produced = 0.480 mol

4. Calculate the enthalpy change using the heat of formation of CO2:
Enthalpy change = moles of CO2 * heat of formation of CO2
Enthalpy change = 0.480 mol * (-393.5 kJ/mol) = -188.88 kJ

The enthalpy change of the polymerization of styrene is -188.88 kJ.
