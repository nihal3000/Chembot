Enthalpy of desorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of desorption of hydrogen gas (H2) from a platinum surface, given that the temperature of the surface is 298 K and the pressure of H2 gas above the surface is 1 atm. The adsorption enthalpy of H2 on Pt is -43300 J/mol. (Assume ideal gas behavior for H2.)
To calculate the enthalpy of desorption of hydrogen gas (H2) from a platinum surface, we can use the following equation:

ΔH_desorption = -ΔH_adsorption

Given that the adsorption enthalpy of H2 on Pt is -43,300 J/mol, the enthalpy of desorption can be calculated as follows:

ΔH_desorption = -(-43,300 J/mol)
ΔH_desorption = 43,300 J/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy of desorption of hydrogen gas (H2) from a platinum surface is 43,300 J/mol.
