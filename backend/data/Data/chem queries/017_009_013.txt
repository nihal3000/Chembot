The photochemical properties of sunscreen agents
What is the optimum wavelength range for sunscreen agents to be effective in protecting the skin from UV radiation?
The optimum wavelength range for sunscreen agents to be effective in protecting the skin from UV radiation is between 290 and 400 nanometers (nm). This range covers both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (290-320 nm) radiation, which are the primary types of ultraviolet radiation that cause skin damage and increase the risk of skin cancer. Sunscreen agents should provide broad-spectrum protection, meaning they should effectively block both UVA and UVB rays within this wavelength range.
