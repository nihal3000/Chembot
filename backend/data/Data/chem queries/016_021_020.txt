Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
Sure! Here's a sample problem:

What is the enthalpy change of polymerization for the formation of polyethylene with a molar mass of 72.15 g/mol from its monomer, ethylene? Assume that the reaction takes place at constant pressure and temperature of 298 K. The heat of formation of ethylene is -20.4 kJ/mol and the heat of formation of polyethylene is -44.0 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change of polymerization, we need to find the difference in heat of formation between the products and reactants. In this case, the reactants are ethylene molecules, and the product is polyethylene.

First, we need to determine the number of ethylene molecules that are involved in the formation of one polyethylene molecule with a molar mass of 72.15 g/mol. The molar mass of ethylene (C2H4) is 12.01 (C) * 2 + 1.01 (H) * 4 = 28.06 g/mol.

Now, we can find the number of ethylene molecules in one polyethylene molecule:
72.15 g/mol (polyethylene) / 28.06 g/mol (ethylene) = 2.57 ≈ 3 ethylene molecules

Since we have approximately 3 ethylene molecules, we can now calculate the enthalpy change of polymerization:

ΔH_polymerization = [1 * (-44.0 kJ/mol) - 3 * (-20.4 kJ/mol)] = -44.0 kJ/mol + 61.2 kJ/mol = 17.2 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change of polymerization for the formation of polyethylene with a molar mass of 72.15 g/mol from its monomer, ethylene, is approximately 17.2 kJ/mol.
