Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of pentene-1 to pentene-2 if 2.5 g of pentene-1 is isomerized using a catalyst and the temperature increases from 25° C to 35° C. The heat capacity of the calorimeter is 15.6 J/deg and the density of the solution is 0.98 g/mL. Assume the heat capacity of the solution is equal to the heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g deg).
To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of pentene-1 to pentene-2, we need to determine the heat absorbed by the solution and the calorimeter during the reaction.

First, let's calculate the heat absorbed by the solution:
q_solution = mass_solution × heat_capacity_solution × ΔT

Since the density of the solution is 0.98 g/mL, we can find the volume of the 2.5 g of pentene-1:
volume = mass / density = 2.5 g / 0.98 g/mL = 2.551 mL

Assuming the volume of the solution is approximately equal to the volume of pentene-1, we can find the mass of the solution:
mass_solution = volume × density = 2.551 mL × 0.98 g/mL = 2.5 g

Now, we can calculate the heat absorbed by the solution:
q_solution = mass_solution × heat_capacity_solution × ΔT
q_solution = 2.5 g × 4.18 J/g °C × (35 °C - 25 °C)
q_solution = 2.5 g × 4.18 J/g °C × 10 °C
q_solution = 104.5 J

Next, let's calculate the heat absorbed by the calorimeter:
q_calorimeter = heat_capacity_calorimeter × ΔT
q_calorimeter = 15.6 J/°C × (35 °C - 25 °C)
q_calorimeter = 15.6 J/°C × 10 °C
q_calorimeter = 156 J

Now, we can find the total heat absorbed during the reaction:
q_total = q_solution + q_calorimeter
q_total = 104.5 J + 156 J
q_total = 260.5 J

Finally, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of pentene-1 to pentene-2 per gram of pentene-1:
ΔH = q_total / mass_pentene-1
ΔH = 260.5 J / 2.5 g
ΔH = 104.2 J/g

The enthalpy change for the isomerization of pentene-1 to pentene-2 is 104.2 J/g.
