Enthalpy of desorption calculations
What is the enthalpy change for the desorption of a molecule of methane from the surface of a nickel catalyst, given that the desorption process releases 50 kJ/mol of energy and the surface area of the catalyst is 100 cmÂ²? Assume that the coverage of methane on the surface is one monolayer.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the desorption of a molecule of methane from the surface of a nickel catalyst, we can use the given information about the energy released during the desorption process.

The desorption process releases 50 kJ/mol of energy. Since energy is released, the enthalpy change is negative, indicating an exothermic process. Therefore, the enthalpy change for the desorption of a molecule of methane from the surface of a nickel catalyst is -50 kJ/mol. 

The surface area of the catalyst and the coverage of methane on the surface do not affect the enthalpy change for the desorption of a single molecule of methane. The enthalpy change is a property of the reaction itself and is independent of the surface area or coverage.
