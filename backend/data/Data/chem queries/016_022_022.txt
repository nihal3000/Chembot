Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene to isobutene given that the enthalpy of combustion for butene is -2671.2 kJ/mol and the enthalpy of combustion for isobutene is -2678.6 kJ/mol. Assume that the molar enthalpy of formation of CO2 and H2O are -393.5 kJ/mol and -241.8 kJ/mol, respectively.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene to isobutene, we can use Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or several steps. In this case, we can use the enthalpy of combustion for butene and isobutene to determine the enthalpy change for the isomerization.

First, let's write the balanced combustion reactions for butene and isobutene:

Butene:
C4H8 (g) + 6 O2 (g) → 4 CO2 (g) + 4 H2O (l)  ΔH_combustion = -2671.2 kJ/mol

Isobutene:
C4H8 (g) + 6 O2 (g) → 4 CO2 (g) + 4 H2O (l)  ΔH_combustion = -2678.6 kJ/mol

Now, we can use Hess's Law to determine the enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene to isobutene:

ΔH_isomerization = ΔH_combustion (isobutene) - ΔH_combustion (butene)

ΔH_isomerization = (-2678.6 kJ/mol) - (-2671.2 kJ/mol)

ΔH_isomerization = -7.4 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change for the isomerization of butene to isobutene is -7.4 kJ/mol.
