Enthalpy of ionization calculations
What is the enthalpy change of ionization for a solution containing 0.1 mol of HCl (aq) if 20 kJ of heat is absorbed during the ionization process?
To calculate the enthalpy change of ionization, we need to divide the heat absorbed by the number of moles of the substance.

Enthalpy change of ionization (ΔH) = Heat absorbed (q) / Number of moles (n)

ΔH = 20 kJ / 0.1 mol

ΔH = 200 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change of ionization for the solution containing 0.1 mol of HCl (aq) is 200 kJ/mol.
