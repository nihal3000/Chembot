Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of adsorption for the adsorption of CO gas on activated carbon at 25°C, given that the equilibrium constant for the reaction is 1.5×10^3 L/mol and the molar density of CO is 1.25 g/L. The surface area of activated carbon used is 50 m^2/g, and the initial pressure of CO is 2.5 atm.
To calculate the enthalpy change of adsorption, we can use the van't Hoff equation:

ΔH = -R * T * (d(lnK)/dT)

Where ΔH is the enthalpy change, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K), and d(lnK)/dT is the derivative of the natural logarithm of the equilibrium constant with respect to temperature. However, we are not given any information about how the equilibrium constant changes with temperature, so we cannot directly use this equation.

Instead, we can use the equilibrium constant (K) and the initial pressure of CO (P) to find the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the adsorption process, and then use the relationship between ΔG, ΔH, and entropy change (ΔS) to find ΔH.

The reaction for the adsorption of CO gas on activated carbon can be written as:

CO(g) ⇌ CO(ads)

The equilibrium constant (K) for this reaction is given as 1.5×10^3 L/mol. We can use the relationship between K and ΔG:

ΔG = -R * T * ln(K)

Plugging in the values:

ΔG = -(8.314 J/mol·K) * (298 K) * ln(1.5×10^3 L/mol)
ΔG ≈ -17200 J/mol

Now we need to find the entropy change (ΔS) for the adsorption process. We can use the initial pressure of CO (P) and the molar density of CO (ρ) to find the molar volume (V) of CO:

V = 1/ρ
V = 1/(1.25 g/L) = 0.8 L/g

Since the surface area of activated carbon used is 50 m^2/g, the total surface area (A) available for adsorption is:

A = 50 m^2/g * 1.25 g/L = 62.5 m^2/L

Assuming that CO molecules form a monolayer on the activated carbon surface, we can estimate the entropy change (ΔS) for the adsorption process as the change in translational entropy of CO molecules:

ΔS ≈ R * ln(A/V)

Plugging in the values:

ΔS ≈ (8.314 J/mol·K) * ln(62.5 m^2/L / 0.8 L/g)
ΔS ≈ 35 J/mol·K

Now we can use the relationship between ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS:

ΔG = ΔH - T * ΔS

Solving for ΔH:

ΔH = ΔG + T * ΔS
ΔH = -17200 J/mol + (298 K) * (35 J/mol·K)
ΔH ≈ -7200 J/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy change of adsorption for the adsorption of CO gas on activated carbon at 25°C is approximately -7200 J/mol.
