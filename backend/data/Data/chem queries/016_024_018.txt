Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
Determine the enthalpy change of precipitation for the reaction between 50ml of 0.1M sodium sulfate and 50ml of 0.1M barium nitrate, given that the final temperature is 25°C and the initial temperature was 30°C. The specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/g °C and the density is 1 g/mL. (Assume the reaction goes to completion and all volumes are additive.)
First, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:

Na2SO4 (aq) + Ba(NO3)2 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2 NaNO3 (aq)

Now, we need to find the limiting reactant. Since both solutions have the same concentration and volume, the limiting reactant will be the one with the smaller stoichiometric coefficient, which is sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) in this case.

Next, we'll calculate the moles of the limiting reactant:

moles of Na2SO4 = (0.1 mol/L) * (0.050 L) = 0.005 mol

Since the volumes are additive, the total volume of the solution is:

total volume = 50 mL + 50 mL = 100 mL

Now, we'll calculate the mass of the solution using the density:

mass of solution = (100 mL) * (1 g/mL) = 100 g

Now, we can calculate the heat change (q) using the specific heat capacity, mass, and temperature change:

q = (mass of solution) * (specific heat capacity) * (ΔT)
q = (100 g) * (4.18 J/g °C) * (25°C - 30°C)
q = 100 g * 4.18 J/g °C * (-5°C)
q = -2090 J

Since the reaction is exothermic, the heat change will be negative. Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change of precipitation (ΔH) by dividing the heat change by the moles of the limiting reactant:

ΔH = q / moles of limiting reactant
ΔH = -2090 J / 0.005 mol
ΔH = -418000 J/mol

The enthalpy change of precipitation for the reaction between 50 mL of 0.1 M sodium sulfate and 50 mL of 0.1 M barium nitrate is -418 kJ/mol.
