Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change of the dissolution of 5 grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 100 mL of water, given the molar enthalpy of dissolution of NaOH to be -44 kilojoules per mole.
To calculate the enthalpy change of the dissolution of 5 grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 100 mL of water, we first need to determine the number of moles of NaOH in 5 grams.

The molar mass of NaOH is:
Na = 22.99 g/mol
O = 16.00 g/mol
H = 1.01 g/mol
Total = 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 40.00 g/mol

Now, we can find the number of moles of NaOH in 5 grams:
moles = mass / molar mass
moles = 5 g / 40.00 g/mol = 0.125 mol

Next, we can use the molar enthalpy of dissolution to find the enthalpy change for the dissolution of 0.125 mol of NaOH. The molar enthalpy of dissolution is -44 kJ/mol, which means that -44 kJ of energy is released per mole of NaOH dissolved.

Enthalpy change = moles × molar enthalpy of dissolution
Enthalpy change = 0.125 mol × -44 kJ/mol = -5.5 kJ

Therefore, the enthalpy change of the dissolution of 5 grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 100 mL of water is -5.5 kJ.
