Enthalpy of desorption calculations
What is the enthalpy change for desorption of water from silica gel, given that 5 grams of silica gel was dried completely and then placed in a closed container with 20 mL of water at 25°C and the resulting equilibrium vapor pressure of water in the container was found to be 8.5 mmHg? Assume the molar enthalpy of condensation for water at 25°C to be -40.7 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy change for desorption of water from silica gel, we first need to determine the amount of water that was adsorbed by the silica gel.

1. Convert the equilibrium vapor pressure of water to atmospheres:
8.5 mmHg * (1 atm / 760 mmHg) = 0.01118 atm

2. Use the Ideal Gas Law (PV = nRT) to find the moles of water vapor in the container:
n = PV / RT
where P = 0.01118 atm, V = 20 mL = 0.02 L, R = 0.0821 L atm / (mol K), and T = 25°C = 298 K.

n = (0.01118 atm * 0.02 L) / (0.0821 L atm / (mol K) * 298 K) = 0.000906 mol

3. Calculate the moles of water that were adsorbed by the silica gel:
Since the container initially had 20 mL of water, we can calculate the initial moles of water:
20 mL * (1 g/mL) * (1 mol / 18.015 g) = 1.111 mol

The moles of water adsorbed by the silica gel is the difference between the initial moles of water and the moles of water vapor in the container:
1.111 mol - 0.000906 mol = 1.110094 mol

4. Calculate the enthalpy change for desorption of water from silica gel:
The enthalpy change for desorption is equal to the negative of the molar enthalpy of condensation multiplied by the moles of water adsorbed:
ΔH = -(-40.7 kJ/mol) * 1.110094 mol = 45.18 kJ

The enthalpy change for desorption of water from silica gel is approximately 45.18 kJ.
