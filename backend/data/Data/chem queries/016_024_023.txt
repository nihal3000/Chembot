Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
Calculate the enthalpy change involved in the precipitation reaction between 50ml of 0.1 M lead nitrate solution and 50ml of 0.1 M sodium chloride solution at a constant temperature of 25°C. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is Pb(NO3)2 + 2NaCl → PbCl2 + 2NaNO3. Standard enthalpies of formation for Pb(NO3)2, NaCl, PbCl2, and NaNO3 are -460.56 kJ/mol, -407.33 kJ/mol, -359.57 kJ/mol, and -467.93 kJ/mol respectively.
To calculate the enthalpy change for the precipitation reaction, we can use the following formula:

ΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)

First, we need to determine the moles of each reactant involved in the reaction. Since we have 50 mL of 0.1 M lead nitrate solution and 50 mL of 0.1 M sodium chloride solution, we can calculate the moles as follows:

moles of Pb(NO3)2 = volume × concentration = 0.050 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.005 mol
moles of NaCl = volume × concentration = 0.050 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.005 mol

Now, we can use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation to determine the moles of products formed:

1 mol Pb(NO3)2 reacts with 2 mol NaCl to form 1 mol PbCl2 and 2 mol NaNO3.

Since we have equal moles of Pb(NO3)2 and NaCl, the reaction will go to completion, and we will have 0.005 mol of PbCl2 and 0.005 mol of NaNO3 formed.

Now we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction using the standard enthalpies of formation:

ΔH_reaction = [(1 mol PbCl2 × -359.57 kJ/mol) + (2 mol NaNO3 × -467.93 kJ/mol)] - [(1 mol Pb(NO3)2 × -460.56 kJ/mol) + (2 mol NaCl × -407.33 kJ/mol)]

ΔH_reaction = [(-359.57 kJ) + (-935.86 kJ)] - [(-460.56 kJ) + (-814.66 kJ)]

ΔH_reaction = (-1295.43 kJ) - (-1275.22 kJ)

ΔH_reaction = -20.21 kJ/mol

Since we have 0.005 mol of reactants, the enthalpy change for this specific reaction is:

ΔH = -20.21 kJ/mol × 0.005 mol = -0.10105 kJ

The enthalpy change involved in the precipitation reaction between 50 mL of 0.1 M lead nitrate solution and 50 mL of 0.1 M sodium chloride solution at 25°C is approximately -0.101 kJ.
