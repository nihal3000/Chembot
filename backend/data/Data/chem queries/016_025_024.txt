Enthalpy of dissolution calculations
The problem that a chemistry student can solve is: 
Calculate the enthalpy change when 25.0 g of NaCl is dissolved in 200.0 g of water, given that the final temperature of the solution is 25.0°C and the initial temperature of the water was 20.0°C. The heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/g°C.
To calculate the enthalpy change, we first need to determine the heat absorbed by the water as it changes temperature. We can do this using the formula:

q = mcΔT

where q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the water, c is the heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Given:
m (mass of water) = 200.0 g
c (heat capacity of water) = 4.184 J/g°C
ΔT (change in temperature) = 25.0°C - 20.0°C = 5.0°C

Now, we can calculate the heat absorbed by the water:

q = (200.0 g)(4.184 J/g°C)(5.0°C) = 4184 J

Since the heat absorbed by the water is equal to the heat released by the NaCl dissolving, the enthalpy change for the dissolution of NaCl can be calculated as:

ΔH = -q

ΔH = -4184 J

The enthalpy change when 25.0 g of NaCl is dissolved in 200.0 g of water is -4184 J.
