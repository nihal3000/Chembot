The photochemical properties of sunscreen agents
How can we improve the photostability of sunscreen agents under UV irradiation?
Improving the photostability of sunscreen agents under UV irradiation can be achieved through several approaches:

1. Combination of UV filters: Using a combination of UV filters with complementary absorption profiles can help to improve the overall photostability of the sunscreen formulation. For example, combining organic filters that absorb UVB radiation with inorganic filters like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide that scatter and absorb UVA radiation can provide broad-spectrum protection and enhance photostability.

2. Encapsulation: Encapsulating the UV filters in micro- or nano-sized particles can protect them from direct exposure to UV radiation, thus enhancing their photostability. This can be achieved using techniques like liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, or polymeric nanoparticles.

3. Use of photostabilizers: Adding photostabilizers such as antioxidants, singlet oxygen quenchers, or triplet state quenchers can help to minimize the photodegradation of UV filters. Common photostabilizers include tocopherol (vitamin E), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and ethylhexyl methoxycrylene.

4. Film-forming polymers: Incorporating film-forming polymers in the sunscreen formulation can help to create a uniform and continuous film on the skin, which can protect the UV filters from direct exposure to UV radiation and improve their photostability.

5. Pre-treatment of UV filters: Some UV filters can be pre-treated with stabilizing agents to improve their photostability. For example, avobenzone can be pre-treated with polyester-8 to enhance its photostability.

6. Optimal concentration: Using the optimal concentration of UV filters can help to achieve the desired sun protection factor (SPF) without compromising the photostability of the formulation. Overloading the formulation with UV filters can lead to aggregation and reduced photostability.

7. Use of newer, more photostable UV filters: Some newer UV filters, such as bemotrizinol (Tinosorb S) and bisoctrizole (Tinosorb M), have been developed with improved photostability compared to traditional UV filters. Incorporating these newer filters in sunscreen formulations can help to enhance photostability.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to improve the photostability of sunscreen agents under UV irradiation, ensuring better protection for the skin and longer-lasting sun protection.
