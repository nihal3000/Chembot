Enthalpy of isomerization calculations
What is the enthalpy change of isomerization for the following reaction?

2-butene --> 1-butene

Given that the heat of formation for 2-butene and 1-butene are -15 kJ/mol and -20 kJ/mol respectively.
To find the enthalpy change of isomerization for the reaction, we can use the following formula:

ΔH = ΔH(products) - ΔH(reactants)

In this case, the reactant is 2-butene and the product is 1-butene. We are given the heat of formation for both:

ΔH(2-butene) = -15 kJ/mol
ΔH(1-butene) = -20 kJ/mol

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:

ΔH = (-20 kJ/mol) - (-15 kJ/mol)

ΔH = -20 kJ/mol + 15 kJ/mol

ΔH = -5 kJ/mol

The enthalpy change of isomerization for the reaction is -5 kJ/mol.
