Enthalpy of polymerization calculations
A certain polymerization reaction has a ΔH°rxn of -250 kJ/mol. If you need to make 500 grams of the polymer, how much energy in kilojoules will be released or absorbed during the reaction?
To solve this problem, we need to know the molecular weight of the polymer. Let's assume the molecular weight of the polymer is "M" grams/mol.

First, we need to find out how many moles of the polymer are present in 500 grams:

moles of polymer = (mass of polymer) / (molecular weight of polymer)
moles of polymer = 500 grams / M grams/mol

Now, we can use the ΔH°rxn value to find out the energy released or absorbed during the reaction:

Energy = moles of polymer × ΔH°rxn
Energy = (500 grams / M grams/mol) × (-250 kJ/mol)

Energy = -125000 / M kJ

The energy released or absorbed during the reaction will depend on the molecular weight of the polymer. If you provide the molecular weight, we can calculate the exact amount of energy released or absorbed. Since the ΔH°rxn is negative, the reaction is exothermic, and energy will be released.
