Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
What is the enthalpy change of precipitation when 50 mL of 0.1 M BaCl2 is mixed with 25 mL of 0.2 M Na2SO4, given that ΔH˚f of BaSO4 is -1464 kJ/mol?
To calculate the enthalpy change of precipitation, we first need to determine the limiting reactant and the number of moles of the product (BaSO4) formed.

The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:

BaCl2(aq) + Na2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq)

First, we'll find the moles of each reactant:

Moles of BaCl2 = (Volume × Molarity) = (50 mL × 0.1 M) = 5 mmol
Moles of Na2SO4 = (Volume × Molarity) = (25 mL × 0.2 M) = 5 mmol

Now, we'll determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio:

Mole ratio of BaCl2 to Na2SO4 = 1:1

Since both reactants have the same number of moles and the mole ratio is 1:1, neither reactant is in excess, and both are limiting reactants. Therefore, 5 mmol of BaSO4 will be formed.

Now, we can calculate the enthalpy change of precipitation:

ΔH = moles of BaSO4 × ΔH˚f of BaSO4
ΔH = 5 mmol × (-1464 kJ/mol)

Since we have the moles in mmol, we need to convert kJ/mol to kJ/mmol:

ΔH = 5 mmol × (-1.464 kJ/mmol) = -7.32 kJ

The enthalpy change of precipitation when 50 mL of 0.1 M BaCl2 is mixed with 25 mL of 0.2 M Na2SO4 is -7.32 kJ.
