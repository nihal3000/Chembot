Enthalpy of desorption calculations
A researcher is working on the desorption of a specific gas from a metal surface. The enthalpy of desorption for this process is -23.4 kJ/mol. If the researcher desorbs 0.75 moles of the gas, how much heat is released (or absorbed)?
To calculate the heat released or absorbed during the desorption process, we can use the following formula:

q = n * ΔH

where q is the heat released or absorbed, n is the number of moles, and ΔH is the enthalpy of desorption.

In this case, n = 0.75 moles and ΔH = -23.4 kJ/mol.

q = 0.75 moles * (-23.4 kJ/mol) = -17.55 kJ

Since the value of q is negative, it means that 17.55 kJ of heat is released during the desorption process.
