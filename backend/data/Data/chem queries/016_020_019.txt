Enthalpy of desorption calculations
Sure, here is a question:

"A sample of 2 grams of methanol is adsorbed on the surface of 1 gram of activated charcoal at 298 K. The measured heat of desorption is 20 kJ/mol. Calculate the enthalpy of desorption per mole of methanol adsorbed on the surface of activated charcoal."
To calculate the enthalpy of desorption per mole of methanol adsorbed on the surface of activated charcoal, we first need to determine the number of moles of methanol in the 2 grams sample.

The molecular weight of methanol (CH3OH) is:
12.01 g/mol (C) + 4.03 g/mol (H) + 16.00 g/mol (O) = 32.04 g/mol

Now, we can calculate the number of moles of methanol in the 2 grams sample:
moles of methanol = mass of methanol / molecular weight of methanol
moles of methanol = 2 g / 32.04 g/mol = 0.0624 mol

The heat of desorption is given as 20 kJ/mol. Since we have calculated the moles of methanol, we can now determine the enthalpy of desorption per mole of methanol adsorbed on the surface of activated charcoal.

Enthalpy of desorption = heat of desorption / moles of methanol
Enthalpy of desorption = 20 kJ/mol / 0.0624 mol = 320.51 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy of desorption per mole of methanol adsorbed on the surface of activated charcoal is 320.51 kJ/mol.
