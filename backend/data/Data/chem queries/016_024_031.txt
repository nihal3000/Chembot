Enthalpy of precipitation calculations
What is the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction between 50 ml of 0.1 M Pb(NO3)2 solution and 75 ml of 0.1 M NaI solution? Given that the standard enthalpy of formation of PbI2 is -360 kJ/mol.
To calculate the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction, we first need to determine the limiting reactant and the number of moles of the product (PbI2) formed.

The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:

Pb(NO3)2 (aq) + 2NaI (aq) â†’ PbI2 (s) + 2NaNO3 (aq)

First, let's find the moles of each reactant:

Moles of Pb(NO3)2 = (0.1 mol/L) * (0.050 L) = 0.005 mol
Moles of NaI = (0.1 mol/L) * (0.075 L) = 0.0075 mol

Now, we need to determine the limiting reactant. The stoichiometry of the reaction shows that 1 mole of Pb(NO3)2 reacts with 2 moles of NaI. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of NaI required to react with the given amount of Pb(NO3)2:

Moles of NaI required = 0.005 mol * 2 = 0.010 mol

Since we have only 0.0075 mol of NaI, NaI is the limiting reactant.

Now, we can calculate the moles of PbI2 formed:

Moles of PbI2 = (0.0075 mol NaI) * (1 mol PbI2 / 2 mol NaI) = 0.00375 mol

Finally, we can calculate the enthalpy of precipitation using the standard enthalpy of formation of PbI2:

Enthalpy of precipitation = moles of PbI2 * standard enthalpy of formation of PbI2
Enthalpy of precipitation = (0.00375 mol) * (-360 kJ/mol) = -1.35 kJ

So, the enthalpy of precipitation for the reaction is -1.35 kJ.
