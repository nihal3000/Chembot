Enthalpy of adsorption calculations
Calculate the enthalpy of adsorption for a reaction where 2 moles of nitrogen gas (N2) are adsorbed on the surface of a solid at -100°C. Given that the partial pressure of N2 in the gas phase is 0.2 atm and the equilibrium constant for adsorption of N2 at this temperature is 2.5 x 10^3. Assume the adsorption is a reversible process and that the ideal gas law can be used to calculate partial pressures.
To calculate the enthalpy of adsorption, we can use the van't Hoff equation, which relates the equilibrium constant (K) to the enthalpy change (ΔH) and temperature (T):

ln(K) = -ΔH / R * (1/T) + C

where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K) and C is a constant.

We are given the equilibrium constant (K) for the adsorption of N2 at -100°C (173.15 K) and the partial pressure of N2 in the gas phase (0.2 atm). We can rearrange the van't Hoff equation to solve for ΔH:

ΔH = -R * T * ln(K) / (1/T)

First, we need to convert the partial pressure of N2 from atm to Pa:

0.2 atm * (101325 Pa/atm) = 20265 Pa

Now, we can plug in the values into the van't Hoff equation:

ΔH = - (8.314 J/mol*K) * (173.15 K) * ln(2.5 x 10^3) / (1/173.15 K)

ΔH = - (8.314 J/mol*K) * (173.15 K) * ln(2.5 x 10^3) * (173.15 K)

ΔH ≈ - (8.314 J/mol*K) * (173.15 K) * 7.824

ΔH ≈ -11237.4 J/mol

Since the adsorption process involves 2 moles of N2, we need to divide the enthalpy change by 2 to obtain the enthalpy of adsorption per mole of N2:

ΔH_adsorption = -11237.4 J/mol / 2

ΔH_adsorption ≈ -5618.7 J/mol

The enthalpy of adsorption for the reaction is approximately -5618.7 J/mol.
